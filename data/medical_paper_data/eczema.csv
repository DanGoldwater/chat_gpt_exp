Atopic dermatitis is a complex disease that arises from interactions between genes and the environment. Loci on several chromosomes have been identified, including a family of epithelium-related genes called the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21. Mutations in filaggrin, a key protein in epidermal differentiation, have also been identified in early-onset and severe atopic dermatitis. There are 3 classical stages of eczema: infantile, childhood, and adulthood. The spectrum of eczema presentation varies widely from a variant that only affect the hand to major forms where a patient presents with erythroderma. The acute and subacute lesions of atopic dermatitis are often characterized by intensely pruritic, erythematous papules and vesicles with excoriations and a serous exudate. Chronic atopic dermatitis is exemplified by lichenified plaques and papules with excoriations. Atopic dermatitis patients are also at higher risk for skin infections, including bacterial and viral superinfections. Conventional therapy includes avoidance of irritants and potential allergens, as well as continued hydration of the skin with thick emollients. Topical corticosteroids and topical immunomodulators are often used primarily. Other therapies including phototherapy, antimicrobials, antihistamines, and systemic immunosuppressives are also options in certain situations."

Many differential diagnoses must be eliminated, including scabies, bullous pemphigoid, and mycosis fungoides. Contact dermatitis may also be considered and the chemical(s) in question may vary according to the comorbidities involved, in particular, depending on whether or not the patient has a leg ulcer. Drug-induced eczematous eruptions can occur in elderly people, mainly with antihypertensive drugs (calcium inhibitors, diuretics, etc.). Recently, de novo atopic dermatitis has been described in elderly subjects, and the role of pollution has been evoked for these eczemas. Management of eczema in the elderly is challenging, and emollients and dermocorticosteroids are helpful. However, local corticosteroids may have some adverse effects in this vulnerable population, such as skin atrophy, diabetes and hypertension. Phototherapy, when possible, and low-dose methotrexate in particular may be interesting treatment options."

Eczema is divided into two subtypes: atopic and non-atopic. These subtypes differ in the level of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum, response to allergens in skin prick tests, and detection of specific IgE antibodies. Non-atopic eczema is characterized by a low level of total IgE, negative skin prick tests, and undetectable specific IgE antibodies. It is estimated that 10-45% cases of eczema are non-atopic ones. In recent studies, other features differentiating these two subtypes have been identified, such as female predominance in non-atopic eczema. A more severe course, damage of the epidermal barrier, predominance of Th2 (T helper cells 2) response, and a lower positive reaction to metal patch tests are the characteristics of the atopic subtype. In our opinion, new diagnostic criteria taking into account the non-atopic subtype of eczema need to be established."

In hand eczema, contact with a contact allergen is a frequent (co-)factor in the triggering and maintenance of eczema. For all hand eczemas lasting longer than 3 months, an allergological examination by means of patch testing is recommended. In patients with allergic contact dermatitis of the hands, nickel, MCI/MI, fragrance mix I, cobalt, thiuram mix, Balsam of Peru, chromium and fragrance mix II have been described in a multicenter European study as the most common contact allergens of the standard series. In the information network of dermatological clinics (IVDK) a total of 56,170 patients were patch-tested in the years 2014 to 2018. In all, 16,807 of these patients (29.9%) suffered from hand eczema, of which 7725 (46.0%) had occupational dermatosis (OD) and 6820 (40.6%) had no OD. For the remaining patients this was unknown. The top 30-list of allergens in hand eczema patients without and with OD included 22 common contact allergens, but with different reaction frequency. In hand eczema patients without OD, the following contact allergens also belong to this list: octyl gallate, sorbic acid, tert-butylhydroquinone, propylene glycol, mercury (II) amide chloride, tolubalsam, jasmine absolute, and sandalwood oil. For hand eczema patients with OD, these are instead: tetramethylthiurammonosulfide, tetramethylthiuramdisulfide, 1,3-diphenylguanidine, p‑phenylenediamine, p‑toluylenediamine, iodopropinylbutylcarbamate, glutaraldehyde, and monoethanolamine. In the case of OD of the hands, early involvement of the responsible statutory accident insurance by initiating the dermatologist procedure (""Hautarztverfahren"") is necessary in order to work together towards successful allergen avoidance by means of substitution and optimizing personal protective equiment."

Assessments were conducted at baseline and every 7 days thereafter. Eczema area severity index score decreased significantly across all time points in both groups compared to baseline (P < .0001), however, this decrease was not significant between groups at day 28 (P = .7804). In contrast, transepidermal water loss and skin hydration significantly improved over time in the active group, while it either stayed the same or worsened in the placebo group (P = .0342 and P < .0001, respectively). There was no difference in the use of mometasone furoate as rescue medication over time between groups (P = .1579). Dermatology life quality index scores improved significantly in both groups (P < .0001), with no difference between groups (P = .5256). However, patient satisfaction was greater in the active compared to the placebo group for several parameters including relief of itch, dry skin, skin softness and smoothness (all P < .05).

Birth cohort studies provide an optimal study design to elucidate these associations and prospectively track longitudinal data including exposure assessment and health outcomes from birth into early life and childhood. This is especially relevant for eczema given the age specific emergence of this disease. In this review, we will provide a general overview of pediatric eczema and discuss the important findings in the literature with respect to genetics and environmental exposures, highlighting those derived from birth cohort studies.

Detailed history is important, particularly with regard to potential exposure to irritants and allergens. Patch testing should be regarded as a standard investigation. Individual treatment outcomes and targets, including systemic therapy, should be discussed early with patients, restoring function being the primary goal, with clearing the skin a secondary outcome. Each new treatment, where appropriate, should be considered additive or overlapping to any previous therapy. Management extends beyond mere pharmacological or physical treatment, and requires an encompassing approach including removal or avoidance of causative factors, behavioural changes and social support. To date, there is little evidence to guide sequences or combinations of therapies. Moderately symptomatic patients (e.g. DLQI ≥ 10) should be started on a potent/super-potent topical corticosteroid applied once or twice per day for 4 weeks, with tapering to twice weekly application. If response is inadequate, consider phototherapy, and then a 12-week trial of a retinoid (alitretinoin or acitretin). Second line systemic treatments include methotrexate, ciclosporin and azathioprine. For patients presenting with severe symptomatic disease (DLQI ≥ 15), consider predniso(lo)ne 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day (or ciclosporin 3 - 5 mg/kg/day) for 4-6 weeks with tapering, and then treating as for moderate disease as above. In non-responders, botulinum toxin and/or iontophoresis, if associated with hyperhidrosis, may sometimes help. Some patients only respond to long-term systemic corticosteroids. The data on sequencing of newer agents, such as dupilumab or JAK inhibitors, are immature."

This study systematically reviews and critically appraises the literature defining flares in eczema, and explores methodological and practical aspects of including eczema flares as outcome measures in trials to inform developing an international consensus definition adding details of our own recent experience. A systematic review was undertaken of flare definitions in prospective intervention studies of eczema published up until 14 February 2013. Data were double-extracted. We pre-specified that important characteristics of a good flare definition should include (i) being feasible to collect and (ii) being recorded at the time flare symptoms were experienced. Three hundred and fourteen papers were identified of which 26 included some description of eczema flares. Overall, 22 different flare definitions were used. Flares were included as the primary outcome in 17 studies (65%). Only four studies (15%) used a patient-reported flare definition. No studies fulfilled all of our pre-specified essential characteristics. No validation studies were identified. The wide variation and lack of validation of flare definitions hampers comparison of findings between studies for this chronic, relapsing disease. None of the currently used definitions seem fit for purpose. Further research should establish which aspects of worsening of disease are most important to patients, and how best to capture these data in a way that is valid, reliable and feasible in all clinical and research settings."

Patients with eczema suffer in a chronic cycle of itch, scratch, and inflammation. For children with severe eczema, constant itching and scratching can have many consequences including skin infections, behavioral issues, and sleep problems. Parents often find themselves searching for a trigger for their child's eczema flare, and after they have switched detergents, applied a thick moisturizer and topical steroids, and removed all wool clothing from their child's wardrobe, they wonder, ""Could food allergies be playing a role?"""

Two authors independently carried out the selection of published works, data extraction, and evaluation of the likelihood of bias. The PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases updated to the date of March 2021 have been researched thoroughly for literature review. Quality Assessment of studies was evaluated using the updated tool (Rob2) provided by the Cochrane collaboration group. Six unique randomized controlled trials from 7 studies including 1,646 mother-infant pairs were contained in this review. Pooled data showed no pronounced decline in the incidence of eczema (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.82~1.46, p = 0.54) or IgE-associated eczema (RR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.29~1.57; p = 0.34).

However, several other recent studies have demonstrated that some allergic diseases can be successfully treated by recurrent epicutaneous exposure to allergens. At a glance, these two sets of findings seem to be contradictory, but we think they provide important clues for understanding the mechanisms behind the allergy march.

For some infants it can be a severe chronic illness with a major impact on the child's general health and on the family. A minority of children will continue to have eczema as adults. The exact cause of eczema is not clear, but precipitating or aggravating factors may include food allergens (most commonly, egg) or environmental allergens/irritants, climatic conditions, stress and genetic predisposition. Management of eczema consists of education; avoidance of triggers and allergens; liberal use of emollients or topical steroids to control inflammation; use of antihistamines to reduce itch; and treatment of infection if present. Treatment with systemic agents may be required in severe cases, but must be supervised by an immunologist. Urticaria (""hives"") may affect up to a quarter of people at some time in their lives. Acute urticaria is more common in children, while chronic urticaria is more common in adults. Chronic urticaria is not life-threatening, but the associated pruritus and unsightly weals can cause patients much distress and significantly affect their daily lives. Angioedema coexists with urticaria in about 50% of patients. It typically affects the lips, eyelids, palms, soles and genitalia. Management of urticaria is through education; avoidance of triggers and allergens (where relevant); use of antihistamines to reduce itch; and short-term use of corticosteroids when antihistamine therapy is ineffective.

Emollients have been shown to be useful in reducing eczema activity and in the primary prevention of hand eczema. Protection of the hands is very important for the prevention of hand eczema and is a fundamental aspect of the treatment of hand eczema. Although topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, few studies of their rational use, efficacy and side-effects have been conducted. A combination of tacrolimus and topical corticosteroids may reduce the risk of steroid-associated side-effects. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and methotrexate show promising results, and acitretin may suppress keratotic hand eczema. Botulinum toxin has been used with success in the treatment of dyshidrotic hand eczema. PUVA is effective as a systemic treatment.
