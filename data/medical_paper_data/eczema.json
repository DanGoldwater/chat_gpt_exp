36-month parent-reported physician-diagnosed bronchial asthma (BA). METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in Nagoya City, Japan, and included 40,242 children who qualified for the 3-month WCVs in the city between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018. In total, 22,052 (54.8%) questionnaires linked to their 36-month WCVs were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of BA was 4.5%. The multivariable Poisson regression model identified male sex (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-1.81), born in autumn (aRR, 1.30; 95% CI: 1.09-1.55), having at least one sibling (aRR, 1.31; 95% CI: 1.15-1.49), wheeze history before 3-month WCVs [with clinic\/hospital visit: aRR, 1.99; 95% CI: 1.53-2.56; hospitalization: aRR, 2.99; 95% CI: 2.09-4.12], eczema with itch (aRR, 1.51; 95% CI: 1.27-1.80), paternal history of BA (aRR, 1.98; 95% CI: 1.66-2.34), maternal history of BA (aRR, 2.11; 95% CI: 1.77-2.49), and rearing pets with fur (aRR, 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.58) were independent risk factors for BA at 36 months of age. The combination of severe wheeze history (with clinic\/hospital visit or hospitalization) and maternal and paternal BA could identify high-risk infants whose prevalence of BA was 20%. CONCLUSIONS: The combined assessment of important clinical factors enabled us to identify high-risk infants set to derive optimal benefit from health guidance provided to the parent or caregiver of the child or infant at WCVs.","1":"BACKGROUND: The mint flavour carvone (l-carvone) is considered a weak contact allergen. However, contact allergy to carvone is more prevalent in patients with oral lichen planus or oral lichenoid lesions (OLP\/OLL). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate how carvone affects sensitized individuals through a use test with toothpaste containing carvone. Non-flavoured toothpaste served as control. METHODS: Subjects were patch tested prior to the use test-14 subjects allergic to carvone (11 with OLP\/OLL), 20 subjects with OLP\/OLL and 3 healthy controls. The month-long use test comprised of using toothpaste twice daily. Subjects were examined fortnightly. Clinical signs were assessed with a mucosal scoring system. The subjects' oral health-related quality of life was measured with the oral health impact profile (OHIP-49). RESULTS: Local reactions to the carvone toothpaste presented as aggravated OLL (7\/10) and peri-oral eczema (2\/10) in allergic subjects. They also had significantly higher mucosal and OHIP scores compared with those receiving non-flavoured toothpaste. CONCLUSION: In sensitized individuals, oral exposure to carvone gives aggravated oral lesions and\/or peri-oral eczema. The lesions mimic OLP and allergic individuals are therefore at risk of not being assessed with regard to flavour contact allergy.","2":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease, and it is considered a complex and heterogeneous condition. Different phenotypes of AD, defined according to the patient age at onset, race, and ethnic background; disease duration; and other disease characteristics, have been recently described, underlying the need for a personalized treatment approach. Recent advancements in understanding AD pathogenesis resulted in a real translational revolution and led to the exponential expansion of the therapeutic pipeline. The study of biomarkers in clinical studies of emerging treatments is helping clarify the role of each cytokine and immune pathway in AD and will allow addressing the unique immune fingerprints of each AD subset. Personalized medicine will be the ultimate goal of this targeted translational research. In this review, we discuss the changes in the concepts of both the pathogenesis of and treatment approach to AD, highlight the scientific rationale behind each targeted treatment and report the most recent clinical efficacy data.","3":"OBJETIVE: To assess cutaneous reactions after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administration. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out in health workers belonging to the city of Guayaquil-Ecuador, from March to May 2021. The participants were contacted through a local registry established by the Universidad Espiritu Santo. Frequencies and percentages were used to represent the proportions of nominal variables, while the mean and standard deviation were used for continuous data, given a normal sample distribution. RESULTS: Local skin reactions were the most frequent, and included redness, edema, and itching. On the other hand, delayed large local skin reactions (generalized rash and pruritus, angioedema, urticaria, eczema, petechiae) were rare and occurred in less than 1.4% of participants, (95% CI = 0.69-1.00). Finally, we did not find cases of anaphylaxis or other life-threatening reactions requiring urgent attention after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that local skin reactions occur in a minority of recipients and are often mild and self-limited.","4":"Combinedimmunodeficiency (CID) due to DOCK8 deficiency is an inborn error of immunity (IBD) characterized by dysfunctional T and B lymphocytes; The spectrum of manifestations includes allergy, autoimmunity, inflammation, predisposition to cancer, and recurrent infections. DOCK8 deficiency can be distinguished from other CIDs or within the spectrum of hyper-IgE syndromes by exhibiting profound susceptibility to viral skin infections, associated skin cancers, and severe food allergies. The 9p24.3 subtelomeric locus where DOCK8 is located includes numerous repetitive sequence elements that predispose to the generation of large germline deletions and recombination-mediated somatic DNA repair. Residual production DOCK8 protein contributes to the variable phenotype of the disease. Severe viral skin infections and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-associated vasculopathy, reflect an essential role of the DOCK8 protein, which is required to maintain lymphocyte integrity as cells migrate through the tissues. Loss of DOCK8 causes immune deficiencies through other mechanisms, including a cell survival defect. In addition, there are alterations in the response of dendritic cells, which explains susceptibility to virus infection and regulatory T lymphocytes that could help explain autoimmunity in patients. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment; it improves eczema, allergies, and susceptibility to infections.","5":"BACKGROUND: Parents of children with eczema are increasingly turning to online parenting forums for advice about managing childhood eczema. Little is known about how parents make sense of advice about eczema treatments in online forums, and how it affects their management of childhood eczema. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how parents of children with eczema make sense of and act upon advice about eczema treatments exchanged in online parenting forums. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative interviews with parents of children with eczema from the United Kingdom. METHOD: 15 parents were recruited through online advertisements and snowball sampling. Semi-structured interviews were carried out face-to-face or by telephone and analysed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: When seeking advice from online parenting forums about eczema treatments, parents described appraising the credibility of advice and considering the potential suitability of treatments that were recommended in the forum. Parents proceeded to making sense of online advice through either reading advice and not engaging in online discussions, or actively engaging in online discussions to direct topics and seek most relevant advice. Parents discussed advice received online in subsequent consultations with their general practitioner and requested prescriptions of recommended treatments. Some parents described trying new treatments without consulting their general practitioner. CONCLUSION: Understanding how parents appraise, make sense of and act upon online advice could support health care professionals to disseminate advice appropriately, ask additional questions and sign-post parents to reliable online resources.","6":"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an uncommon X-linked inherited disorder related to primary immunodeficiency, infections, eczema, and thrombocytopenia. A 21-year-old male patient with this syndrome underwent descending aortic aneurysm repair at the age of 12. The patient had ascending aortic aneurysm with aortic valve regurgitation and surgical aortic root replacement was performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome operated due to aneurysms development in different segments of the thoracic aorta in both childhood and young adult periods.","7":"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested associations of atopic dermatitis (AD) with conjunctivitis and other ocular surface diseases (OSDs). It is still unclear, however, whether or in which direction causal relationships exist, because these associations could be confounded. Objective Our study aims to examine the causal association of AD with conjunctivitis and other OSDs. METHODS: A bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level statistics. Genetic instruments for AD from a GWAS meta-analysis study conducted by the EArly Genetics & Lifecourse Epidemiology eczema consortium were used to investigate AD's relationships to conjunctivitis and other OSDs among cases from the FinnGen consortium. Genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Causal estimates were derived by the inverse-variance weighted method and were verified through a series of sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Genetically predicted AD linked to higher risk of conjunctivitis (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.65; P=8.65x10(-13) ) and allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.31-1.77; P=3.77 x10(-8) ), as well as atopic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.76; 95%CI, 1.24-2.52; P=1.76x10(-3) ). Additionally, suggestive causal effects of AD on chronic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.76; 95%CI, 1.24-2.52; P=5.78x10(-3) ) and keratitis (OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.01-1.30; P=3.58x10(-2) ) were found. No significant causal effect of AD was identified in relation to keratitis, keratoconus and pterygium. Concerning the reverse directions, no significant associations were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this MR study support a causal effect between AD and conjunctivitis, but not vice versa. These findings have clinical implications for the management of AD and conjunctivitis.","8":"Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is considered a high global disease burden; hence, the shortage of knowledge would lead to poor adherence to management and preventive measures and increase the exacerbation of AR symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors, and assess the knowledge and practices of the population regarding AR among the population in Makkah city, Saudi Arabia. Methodology This was an online survey cross-sectional study conducted in December 2022 via social media platforms (WhatsApp and Twitter) to collect data on participants' demographics, prevalence, risk factors, knowledge, and attitudes toward AR, using a validated Arabic version of a self-administered questionnaire. Results The study involved 466 participants. Of the participants, 55.8% were aged 31 to 45 years, and 286 (61.4%) were females. The prevalence of AR among the participants was 45%. The most common symptoms were a blocked nose (79.6%), sneezing (74.2%), and a runny nose (71.5%). Furthermore, the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis in this study was 56%. The most common inhalant allergen was house dust (73.0%). Only the age and history of asthma or eczema were significant factors associated with AR. Overall, most of the subjects (94.85%) had adequate knowledge regarding AR. Conclusion A high prevalence of AR was observed. Understanding the factors linked with AR is imperative to ensure better adherence to preventive management plans.","9":"INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD)-a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense itching-can have a detrimental impact on quality of life (QoL). We report results of a quantitative assessment of pediatric patient, caregiver, and physician perceptions of AD burden in children and adolescents. METHODS: Pediatric patients (aged 6-11 [children] or 12-17 [adolescents] years) with moderate-to-severe AD, their caregivers, and independent physicians were recruited in 13 countries. Caregivers and their children\/adolescents completed an online survey about the impact of AD on 16 key items of patient QoL. Physicians completed surveys on their patients aged 6-11 and 12-17 years. Best-worst scaling was used to rank the importance of the QoL items. RESULTS: Overall, 1447 children\/adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD (aged 6-11 years: 701; 12-17 years: 746), 1447 caregivers, and 1092 physicians participated. Patients and caregivers in both age groups ranked disturbed sleep as the most important QoL item, followed by feeling ashamed because of AD. Independent physicians ranked feeling ashamed because of AD as the most important QoL item for both age groups, followed by disturbed sleep for those aged 6-11 years and being singled out for those aged 12-17 years. The relative importance of the 16 QoL items to patients was strongly aligned between patients in both age groups and their caregivers, but somewhat less so between patients and physicians. Between-country differences were more apparent in physician- versus patient-\/caregiver-reported results. CONCLUSION: The most burdensome QoL items were impact of AD on sleep and feeling ashamed. Caregivers and physicians correctly identified the QoL items most burdensome to patients. However, patient and caregiver perceptions were generally more closely aligned than patient and physician perceptions. Between-country differences in perceptions (particularly for physicians) were observed, probably due to multifactorial reasons, necessitating further evaluation.

After this study obtained authorization for the Chinese version of the ADCT scale. 114 patients with atopic dermatitis were enrolled from the Department of Dermatology, Peking University First Hospital using convenience sampling from October 2022. Patients were surveyed using the General Information Questionnaire, Chinese version of ADCT, patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM),peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS),dermatology life quality index (DLQI) and the global patient self-assessment for disease severity. Mann-Whitney rank sum test and Spearman correlation analysis were used for item analysis; content validity was assessed using content validity index (CVI); exploratory factor analysis was used to assess structural validity; Cronbach' alpha coefficient was used to assess internal consistency; Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation of ADCT with other scales to assess external responsiveness. The results showed that all items were retained by item analysis. I-CVI was 0.9-1, and S-CVI\/Average was 0.983; the scale extracted one common factor by factor analysis, the cumulative variance explanation rate was 77.927%; the Cronbach' alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.937; the correlation coefficients of the Chinese version of ADCT with POEM, PP-NRS, and DLQI were 0.805, 0.861, and 0.709 respectively. In conclusion, the Chinese version of the ADCT has adequate reliability, validity and responsiveness, and is suitable for measuring disease control in Chinese patients with atopic dermatitis.","11":"BACKGROUND: Lebrikizumab, a high-affinity IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-13, prevents the formation of the interleukin-4Ralpha-interleukin-13Ralpha1 heterodimer receptor signaling complex. METHODS: We conducted two identically designed, 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials; both trials included a 16-week induction period and a 36-week maintenance period. Eligible patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (adults [>\/=18 years of age] and adolescents [12 to <18 years of age, weighing >\/=40 kg]) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either lebrikizumab at a dose of 250 mg (loading dose of 500 mg at baseline and week 2) or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Outcomes for the induction period were assessed up to 16 weeks and are included in this report. The primary outcome was an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (indicating clear or almost clear skin; range, 0 to 4 [severe disease]) with a reduction (indicating improvement) of at least 2 points from baseline at week 16. Secondary outcomes included a 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI-75 response) and assessments of itch and of itch interference with sleep. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: In trial 1, the primary outcome was met in 43.1% of 283 patients in the lebrikizumab group and in 12.7% of 141 patients in the placebo group (P<0.001); an EASI-75 response occurred in 58.8% and 16.2%, respectively (P<0.001). In trial 2, the primary outcome was met in 33.2% of 281 patients in the lebrikizumab group and in 10.8% of 146 patients in the placebo group (P<0.001); an EASI-75 response occurred in 52.1% and 18.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Measures of itch and itch interference with sleep indicated improvement with lebrikizumab therapy. The incidence of conjunctivitis was higher among patients who received lebrikizumab than among those who received placebo. Most adverse events during the induction period were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to trial discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: In the induction period of two phase 3 trials, 16 weeks of treatment with lebrikizumab was effective in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

The literature has not yet established a single ubiquitous disease or term for these eruptions in adults over the age of 65 years. Instead, CEEA is attributed various names, including immunologic eruption of aging, and eruption of immunosenescence. Atopic dermatitis in the elderly, eczema in the elderly, and late- or adult-onset atopic dermatitis or eczema likely also fall under the umbrella of CEEA, given that older patients often do not meet strict criteria for atopic dermatitis. As a reflection of such terminological heterogeneity, CEEA does not have a standardized workup algorithm. This lack of uniformity can obscure the ability to study and understand appropriate treatments for this condition. Yet, as providers become increasingly aware of CEEA and more comfortable in making this diagnosis in older adults, it is necessary that dermatologists understand the safety and efficacy of common CEEA treatments in this population. Here, we discuss special considerations, challenges, and recommendations for treating older adults with CEEA with topical and systemic therapeutics. We provide an overview of therapeutic strategies and potential barriers to treatment and discuss the essential role of shared decision making when caring for this patient population.","13":"Dear Editor,Mammary Paget's disease (MPD) is an adenocarcinoma localized within the epidermis of the nipple and\/or the areola of the breast, and it is as a rule associated with a carcinoma of the underlying lactiferous ducts, where it usually starts. MPD is relatively rare, observed in 0.7-4.3% of all breast cancers (1). We present a patient with MPD and atypical clinical finding as an annular plaque. A 74-year-old Japanese woman with a past medical history of hypothyroidism presented with a 6-month history of an itching plaque on the left areola. The patient had been treated with the application of topical steroids for a duration of approximately 5 months, and showed no clinical improvement. Physical examination showed a pink plaque encircling the nipple on the left areola (Figure 1, a). The right nipple and areola appeared normal (Figure 1, b). No palpable masses were detected within either breast. A 3.5 mm punch biopsy of the skin at the 6 o'clock position of the left areola was performed. Histological examination showed single and small aggregations of atypical cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei and pale-staining, ample cytoplasm throughout the epidermis. There was a lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis (Figure 1, c). Immunohistochemical studies were positive for CK7 and negative for S-100 and HMB45. With the diagnosis of MPD, the patient underwent a partial mastectomy of the left breast center area, consisting of surgical excision of the left nipple, the adjacent surrounding areolar skin, and subcutaneous tissues. Subsequently, radiation therapy for the residual breast was prepared. As has been described in detail by Kanitakis, the skin lesion develops insidiously as a scaly, fissured, or oozing erythema of the nipple and, more rarely, the areola. Advanced lesions present as a well-demarcated, round, ovoid, or polycyclic eczema-like plaque with a pink or red hue. It is occasionally slightly infiltrated and has an erosive, oozing, scaly, or crusted surface. The lesions are almost invariably unilateral, showing centrifugal spread. Retraction or ulceration of the nipple are often noted (1). The present case exhibited a very rare clinical finding of a plaque encircling the nipple, which has not been reported previously. It was initially difficult to establish the diagnosis of MPD, and biopsy was needed to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of MPD comprises eczema as atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, erosive adenomatosis, and malignant skin condition such as Bowen's disease, superficial basal cell carcinoma, or superficially spreading melanoma. As in the present case, individuals presenting with an annular plaque are often considered to have sebaceous hyperplasia. Sebaceous hyperplasia is a common, benign skin condition involving hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands, common in middle-aged or older adults (2). These lesions can be single or multiple and manifest as yellow, soft, small papules. These papules are occasionally seen around the nipple, forming an annular plaque. In general, sebaceous hyperplasia is described as yellow-colored papules among Caucasians. However, caution is needed, since it is characterized by skin-colored papules among some Asians.In the present case, some pigmentation (2 to 3 mm in diameter) was observed on the left nipple. Pigmented MPD have been reported, and the mechanism underlying the pigmentation is not yet fully understood, but it has been proposed that Paget cells may release melanocytic chemoattractants or basic fibroblast growth factors that stimulate the proliferation of melanocytes within the tumor nests (3). The possibility of physiological pigmentation cannot be ruled out in the present case; on the other hand, the possibility of pigmented MPD cannot be ruled out either, since no pigmentation was observed on the right nipple.","14":"Background: COVID-19 hand hygiene recommendation had resulted in a hand eczema -exacerbation. The guidelines of care for the management of hand eczema recommend the use of educational interventions for patients. Objective: An educational intervention was designed to increase the patient's knowledge of appropriate hand hygiene and improve the patient's symptoms. Methods: The validated self-assessment patient-oriented eczema measure tool and pre- and post-tests were used to measure outcomes prior to educational intervention and again in 1-2 months postintervention. Of the 26 participants enrolled, 21 completed the study. The study included newly diagnosed or established patients with eczema, and the education material was available for all patients. Results: The difference between the average pretest and initial posttest was statistically significant (df = 20, P (T <\/= t) = 0.000663535, p < .05). Similarly, the difference between the average pretest and follow-up posttest was also statistically significant (df = 20, P (T <\/= t) < 0.001, p < .05). Participants also had a 2.04 mean point decrease in symptoms severity. Conclusions: The results demonstrated an improvement in patient's knowledge and reduction in symptoms. Implications for Nursing: The program can serve as a new guideline for managing hand eczema symptoms due to COVID-19 in the adult population in the private office setting.","15":"Background: Evidence-based recommendations for optimal showering\/bathing practices are lacking for atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Objective: To determine longitudinal associations between showering\/bathing practices and AD severity in AD patients. Methods: A prospective single-center dermatology practice-based study was performed. Shower\/bath frequency and duration, and frequency of applying moisturizers after showering\/bathing were evaluated. AD severity was assessed using objective component of Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (o-SCORAD), SCORAD-itch, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Repeated-measures regression models examined associations of showering\/bathing and moisturizing practices with change in AD severity measures over time. Results: Showering\/bathing more than daily versus once daily was associated with higher SCORAD-itch, o-SCORAD, EASI, POEM, and DLQI scores; less than daily versus once daily showering\/bathing was not associated with any outcomes. Consistent and even inconsistent application of moisturizer after showering\/bathing was associated with lower o-SCORAD, EASI, and POEM scores. Showering\/bathing duration was not associated with AD outcomes. Severe SCORAD-sleep, o-SCORAD, EASI, and POEM were associated with less adherence to all showering\/bathing recommendations. Conclusion: Showering\/bathing daily or less frequently and applying moisturizer postshower\/bath were associated with lower AD severity; showering\/bathing duration was not. Recommendations concerning shower durations may not be necessary when counseling AD patients.","16":"Objective: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) experience decreased quality of life (QoL). Here we describe the relationship between severity and QoL-related scores in patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab. Patients and Methods: This was a real-life, retrospective, and observational study involving patients with AD treated with dupilumab. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated based on the changes in the eczema area and severity index (EASI), sleep quality numerical rating scale ,and pruritus numerical rating scale (PNRS), as well as the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). The relationship between each of them was analyzed. After the first data collection at baseline, patients were re-evaluated at 3 subsequent follow-ups (4, 8, and 12 months). Results: A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study. At 4 months, the change in DLQI is more correlated with PNRSs (r = 0.643, P < 0.001) than the other scores considered. At 8 months, however, the change in DLQIs correlates similarly both with PNRSs (r = 0.644, P < 0.001) and with the change in EASIs (r = 0.633, P < 0.001). At 12 months of treatments, however, the trend reverses and the correlation with EASIs becomes higher (r = 0.735, P < 0.001) than PNRSs (r = 0.0.659, P < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of our study show that the reduction in the impact on QoL for AD patients in the first months of therapy with dupilumab correlates more with the control of pruritus than with the disappearance of skin lesions.","17":null,"18":"Background: Little is known about the relationship of atopic dermatitis (AD) severity, phenotype, and persistence on different types of skin infections. Objective: To evaluate the relationship of AD characteristics and skin infections over time in adults. Methods: We performed a prospective dermatology practice-based study (n = 559). History of infection was assessed using questionnaires. AD severity was evaluated using Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and Patient-reported Global Assessment (PtGA). Results: At baseline, 160 (21.4%) patients reported history of >\/=1 skin infection, including 14.3% with bacterial infections. In multivariable repeated measures logistic regression models, >\/=1 cutaneous infection was associated with moderate (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.67 [1.67-4.28]) and severe (6.35 [3.36-12.01]) versus mild SCORAD; as well as severe SCORAD-itch; moderate and severe versus clear-mild EASI; moderate and severe versus clear-mild PtGA; mild, moderate, and severe versus clear-almost clear IGA. Cutaneous infections were not associated with ichthyosis, palmar hyperlinearity, nummular eczema, cheilitis, or hand eczema. Specific infections varied by AD severity and body site. Persistent moderate-severe disease was associated with higher odds of skin infection. Conclusion: Skin infections were associated with AD severity but not phenotype, and may be mitigated by improved AD severity.","19":"BACKGROUND: Childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) is often followed by other atopic comorbidities like asthma. OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of topical tacrolimus (TAC) and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and their impact on airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in pediatric AD. METHODS: A three-year randomized open-label comparative follow-up study of 152 one- to three-year-old children with moderate-to-severe AD. Frequent study visits including clinical examinations, laboratory investigations (total IgE, specific IgEs, blood eosinophils), skin prick and respiratory function tests to assess airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (exhaled nitric oxide, airway responsiveness to exercise and methacholine), were performed. RESULTS: Changes in eczema parameters at 36 months were similar in the TCS and TAC groups for mean body surface area difference 1.4 (95% CI -1.48 to 4.19; P=.12), mean Eczema Area and Severity Index difference 0.2 (95% CI -1.38 to 1.82; P=.2), mean Investigator Global Assessment difference, 0.3 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.67; P=.12), and mean transepidermal water loss difference at eczema site, 0.3 (95% CI -4.93 to 4.30; P=.96), and at control site, 9.0 (95% CI 0.96 to 3.60, P=.19). Control TEWL increased more towards end in TCS vs TAC group (mean change difference 4.2; 95% CI -8.14 to -0.29; P=.0.04). No significant impact on development of airway inflammation or bronchial hyperresponsiveness occurred between early effective eczema-treatment responders vs others. CONCLUSION: Children with moderate-to-severe AD benefit from long-term treatment with TCS or TAC. There were no significant differences in treatment efficacy. No differences on impact on airways occurred between early effective treatment responders vs others. (EudraCT2012-002412-95).","20":"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease that manifests in skin dryness, severe itching, and eczema, and can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Current treatment regimens do not prevent the recurrence of the disease and are associated with adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of moderate-to-severe AD in children that were treated with dupilumab, a dual inhibitor of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, in combination with mite allergen-specific immunotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: Both patients presented with the diagnosis of AD that was not adequately controlled by the conventional treatment regimen, including topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, emollients, and the traditional Chinese medicine treatments. In both patients, AD-associated skin irritation impacted the quality of life, disturbed sleep patterns, and caused stress and anxiety.Patients received treatment with dupilumab and mite allergen-specific immunotherapy in addition to the baseline treatment regimen of external glucocorticoids (TCS) and oral antihistamines. Nine months after beginning of treatment, clinical symptoms, signs, medication scores, and evaluation scale scores of both children significantly improved, and the treatment was associated with an overall good tolerance. CONCLUSION: A combination of dupilumab and mite allergen-specific immunotherapy in addition to the standard anti-AD treatment improves clinical symptoms and is not associated with increased incidence of adverse effects.","21":"BACKGROUND: Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) is the most common food allergy in children. The reaction is classified into IgE-mediated immediate reaction and delayed-onset, according to the underlying immune mechanism, and hence, the timing of the symptoms. Case reports suggest that children, with delayed CMPA reactions on elimination diet, may develop severe immediate reactions on reintroduction. AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and the risk factors of developing immediate reactions to milk and dairy products in children with CMPA whose initial presentations were of delayed type. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children, aged 0-12 years, presented with delayed type CMPA reactions to the allergy-clinical immunology clinics, was performed. The diagnosis was made clinically, and with appropriate allergy tests when indicated. RESULTS: Sixty children were included. Males:female ratio was 1.7:1. Family history of atopy was in 72%, and 57% had personal history of atopy. Sixty percent were not breast fed. The most common concomitant food allergy was egg. The most common initial presentation was diarrhea without protein loss or bleeding followed by exacerbation of atopic dermatitis upon exposure to dairy products. Immediate reactions developed in 21.6% upon re-exposure. There were significant associations with concomitant food allergy (OR 56.6 (3.15-1016.1) P<0.0001), especially eggs (OR 12.85 (3.09-53.5) P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Children with CMPA, who present with delayed-type allergic reactions, may be at a significant risk of developing immediate reactions upon reintroduction. Evaluation of possible IgE-mediated allergic reactions before reintroduction may be advisable.","22":"BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are commonly prescribed to treat inflammatory skin diseases, and appropriate prescription is necessary for treatment success. OBJECTIVE: To quantify differences between TCS prescribed by dermatologists at consultation and family physicians for patients treated for any skin condition. METHODS: Using administrative health data in Ontario, we included all Ontario Drug Benefit recipients who filled at least one TCS prescription from a dermatologist at consultation and a family physician in the year prior between January 2014 and December 2019. We estimated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals in amount (in grams) and potency between the index dermatologist prescription and the highest and most recent family physician prescription amounts and potencies in the preceding year using linear mixed-effect models. RESULTS: A total of 69,335 persons were included. The mean dermatologist amount was 34% larger than the highest amount and 54% larger than the most recent amount prescribed by family physicians. There were small but statistically significant differences in potency using established 7-category and 4-category potency classification systems. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to family physicians, dermatologists prescribed substantially larger amounts and similarly potent TCS at consultation. Further research is needed to determine the effect of these differences on clinical outcomes.","23":"BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that early egg introduction during infancy may help to prevent egg allergy development. However, the infant egg consumption frequency that is sufficient to induce this immune tolerance remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: We examined the associations between the infant egg consumption frequency and maternal-reported child egg allergy at 6 y. METHODS: We analyzed data of 1252 children from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (2005-2012). Mothers reported the frequency of infant egg consumption at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12 mo old. Mothers reported the status of their child's egg allergy at the 6-y follow-up. We used Fisher exact test, Cochran-Armitage Trend Test, and log Poisson regression models to compare 6-y egg allergy risk by the frequency of infant egg consumption. RESULTS: The risk of maternal-reported egg allergy at 6 y significantly (P-trend = 0.004) decreased with infant egg consumption frequency at 12 mo: 2.05% (11\/537) for infants not consuming eggs, 0.41% (1\/244) for those consuming eggs <2 times per wk, and 0.21% (1\/471) for those consuming eggs >\/=2 times per wk. A similar but nonsignificant trend (P-trend=0.109) was observed for egg consumption at 10 mo (1.25%, 0.85%, and 0%, respectively). After adjusting for socioeconomic confounders, breastfeeding, complementary food introduction, and infant eczema, infants who consumed eggs >\/=2 times per wk at 12 mo had a significantly lower RR of maternal-reported egg allergy at 6 y (confounder-adjusted RR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.88; P = 0.038), whereas those who consumed <2 times per wk (confounder-adjusted RR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.67; P = 0.141) did not have a significantly lower risk than those who did not consume eggs at all. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of eggs >\/=2 times per wk in late infancy is associated with a reduced risk of developing egg allergy later in childhood.","24":null,"25":"Introduction: Components of the immune response have previously been associated with the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD), specifically the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class II region via genome-wide association studies, however the exact elements have not been identified. Methods: This study examines the genetic variation of HLA Class II genes using next generation sequencing (NGS) and evaluates the resultant amino acids, with particular attention on binding site residues, for associations with AD. The Genetics of AD cohort was used to evaluate HLA Class II allelic variation on 464 subjects with AD and 384 controls. Results: Statistically significant associations with HLA-DP alpha and beta alleles and specific amino acids were found, some conferring susceptibility to AD and others with a protective effect. Evaluation of polymorphic residues in DP binding pockets revealed the critical role of P1 and P6 (P1: alpha31M + (beta84G or beta84V) [protection]; alpha31Q + beta84D [susceptibility] and P6: alpha11A + beta11G [protection]) and were replicated with a national cohort of children consisting of 424 AD subjects. Independently, AD susceptibility-associated residues were associated with the G polymorphism of SNP rs9277534 in the 3' UTR of the HLA-DPB1 gene, denoting higher expression of these HLA-DP alleles, while protection-associated residues were associated with the A polymorphism, denoting lower expression. Discussion: These findings lay the foundation for evaluating non-self-antigens suspected to be associated with AD as they potentially interact with particular HLA Class II subcomponents, forming a complex involved in the pathophysiology of AD. It is possible that a combination of structural HLA-DP components and levels of expression of these components contribute to AD pathophysiology.","26":"INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases adversely affecting the quality of life of both patients and their families. Heliotherapy, a treatment modality with high anti-inflammatory effects, is unjustifiably neglected in a country that has plenty of sunshine days throughout the year, but does not own the Cabinet for artificial phototherapy. AIM: To evaluate the power of individual heliotherapy in ameliorating disease severity and improving the quality of life, as well as to compare the results with those obtained from the studies evaluating group heliotherapies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed disease severity and quality of life at three times: before commencing heliotherapy (Time 1), immediately after heliotherapy (Time 2), and 3 months after heliotherapy (Time 3). The tools we used are authorized scoring systems and questionnaires: SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Severity of Pruritus Scale (SPS). RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were analysed in this observational study. Good clinical results were observed with a statistically significant decrease in SCORAD index by 40% and 31.1% at Time 2 and Time 3, respectively (p < 0.001). Improvement in the quality of life was statistically significant showing a decrease in DLQI score by 31.57% 3 months after heliotherapy, comparing to baseline values (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that 2-week heliotherapy has shown satisfying, long-lasting effects in clearing the skin changes, reducing and ameliorating pruritus intensity, as well as improving the quality of life.","27":"BACKGROUND: A subgroup of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients suffer from recurrent, disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) skin infections, termed eczema herpeticum (EH), which can be life-threatening and contribute to AD morbidity. The pathobiology underlying ADEH is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine transcriptional mechanisms of skin and immune system pathobiology that underlie ADEH disease. METHODS: We performed whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing of non-lesional skin samples (epidermis, dermis) of AD patients with (ADEH (+) , n=15) and without (ADEH (-) , n=13) recurrent EH history, and healthy controls (HC, n=15). We also performed RNA-sequencing on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) collected from these participants and infected in vitro with HSV-1. Differential expression, gene set enrichment, and endotyping analyses were performed. RESULTS: ADEH (+) disease was characterized by dysregulation in skin gene expression, which was limited in dermis (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]=14) and widespread in epidermis (DEGs=129). ADEH (+) -upregulated epidermal DEGs were enriched in type 2 cytokine (T2) ( IL4R, CCL22, CRLF2, IL7R ), interferon ( CXCL10, ICAM1, IFI44 , and IRF7) , and IL-36gamma ( IL36G ) inflammatory pathway genes. At a person-level, all ADEH (+) participants exhibited T2 and interferon endotypes and 87% were IL36G-high. In contrast, these endotypes were more variably expressed among ADEH (-) participants. ADEH (+) patient skin also exhibited dysregulation in epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) genes within the LCE, S100 , and SPRR families, which are involved in skin barrier function, inflammation, and antimicrobial activities. pDC transcriptional responses to HSV-1 infection were not altered by ADEH status. CONCLUSIONS: ADEH (+) pathobiology is characterized by a unique, multi-faceted epidermal inflammation that accompanies dysregulation in the expression of EDC genes. KEY MESSAGES: AD patients with a history of recurrent EH exhibit molecular skin pathobiology that is similar in form, but more severe in degree, than in AD patients without this complication. Non-lesional skin of ADEH (+) patients concurrently exhibits excessive type 2 cytokine, interferon, and IL-36gamma-driven epidermal inflammation. Expression of these inflammatory skin endotypes among ADEH (+) patients is associated with dysregulation in expression of epidermal differentiation complex genes involved in barrier function, inflammation, and antimicrobial activity. CAPSULE SUMMARY: AD patients with a history of recurrent disseminated HSV-1 skin infections form a unique molecular skin endotype group that concurrently exhibits type 2 cytokine, interferon, and IL-36gamma-driven skin inflammation, accompanied by dysregulation in expression of epidermal differentiation complex genes involved in barrier function, inflammation, and antimicrobial activity.","28":null,"29":"BACKGROUND: A high rate of COVID-19 vaccination is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality related to infection and to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the factors that influence vaccine confidence can inform policies and programs aimed at vaccine promotion. We examined the impact of health literacy on COVID-19 vaccine confidence among a diverse sample of adults living in two major metropolitan areas. METHODS: Questionnaire data from adults participating in an observational study conducted in Boston and Chicago from September 2018 through March 2021 were examined using path analyses to determine whether health literacy mediates the relationship between demographic variables and vaccine confidence, as measured by an adapted Vaccine Confidence Index (aVCI). RESULTS: Participants (N = 273) were on average 49 years old, 63 % female, 4 % non-Hispanic Asian, 25 % Hispanic, 30 % non-Hispanic white, and 40 % non-Hispanic Black. Using non-Hispanic white and other race as the reference category, Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower aVCI (-0.76, 95 % CI -1.00 to -0.50; -0.52, 95 % CI -0.80 to -0.27, total effects from a model excluding other covariates). Lower education was also associated with lower aVCI (using college or more as the reference, -0.73 for 12th grade or less, 95 % CI -0.93 to -0.47; -0.73 for some college\/associate's\/technical degree, 95 % CI -1.05 to -0.39). Health literacy partially mediated these effects for Black and Hispanic participants and those with lower education (indirect effects -0.19 and -0.19 for Black race and Hispanic ethnicity; 0.27 for 12th grade or less; -0.15 for some college\/associate's\/technical degree). CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of education, Black race, and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower scores on health literacy, which in turn were associated with lower vaccine confidence. Our findings suggest that efforts to improve health literacy may improve vaccine confidence, which in turn may improve vaccination rates and vaccine equity. CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT03584490.","30":"Skin conditions are amongst the most prevalent health issues in the world and come with a heavy economic, social, and psychological burden. Incurable and chronic skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, fungal infections are linked to major morbidity in the manner of physical pain and a reduction in quality life of patients. Several drugs have difficulties for penetrating the skin due to the barrier mechanism of the skin layers and the incompatible physicochemical characteristics of the drugs. This has led to the introduction of innovative drug delivery methods. Currently, formulations depend on nanocrystals have indeed been researched for topical administration of drugs and have resulted in enhanced skin penetration. This review focuses on skin penetration barriers, modern methods to enhance topical distribution, and the use of nanocrystals to overcome these barriers. By means of mechanisms such as adherence to skin, creation of diffusional corona, targeting of hair follicles, and the generation of a greater concentration gradient throughout the skin, nanocrystals could enhance transport across the skin. Scientists working on product formulations incorporating chemicals that are \"challenging-to-deliver\" topically may find the most current findings to be of relevance.","31":"INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD), with its signs and symptoms of pruritus, dryness, and erythema, severely reduces the quality of life (QOL) of affected patients. We investigated the impact of nemolizumab 60 mg on QOL in Japanese patients aged >\/= 13 years with AD and inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe pruritus, using data derived from patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. METHODS: PROs were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Atopic Dermatitis questionnaire (WPAI-AD). Correlations between PRO scores and symptom severity, assessed by the pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), were explored. RESULTS: The mean percent change (standard error) from baseline in the pruritus VAS and EASI scores at week 16 was, respectively, -45.6% (2.7) and -46.0% (3.2) in the nemolizumab group, and -24.1% (3.7) and -33.2% (4.9) in the placebo group. By week 16, significantly more patients in the nemolizumab group versus the placebo group had an ISI score of 0 for difficulty falling asleep (41.6% versus 13.1%, nominal p < 0.01) or difficulty staying asleep (45.4% versus 10.9%; nominal p < 0.01). Similarly, more nemolizumab- than placebo-treated patients had a DLQI score of 0 for interference with shopping, or home\/garden activities (45.2% versus 18.6%, nominal p < 0.01), and 0 days per week of nighttime sleep disturbance (50.8% versus 16.9%, nominal p < 0.01) or bleeding skin (43.4% versus 7.5%, nominal p < 0.01) measured by POEM at week 16. Based on WPAI-AD scores, long-term administration of nemolizumab also improved the ability to conduct work activities. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous administration of nemolizumab ameliorated pruritus and skin signs, and thereby produced improvement in patient QOL across multiple PRO measures, including sleep, interpersonal relationships, and the ability to conduct social or work activities.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of skin diseases by sex in a sample of prisoners in Taiwan. METHODS: We included 83,048 participants from the National Health Insurance Program. The outcomes were measured using the clinical version of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. For prevalence, we presented absolute values as well as percentages. We also conducted an X(2) test to assess sex differences and age group differences in the percentages of skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases. RESULTS: The prevalence of skin diseases was 42.25%, higher than that in the general population. The prevalence of skin diseases among male prisoners was higher than that among female prisoners (p < 0.001), and the prevalence of skin diseases among prisoners who were <\/= 40 was higher than that among prisoners who were > 40. Among all cases diagnosed with skin disease, the top three diseases were contact dermatitis and other types of eczema, cellulitis and abscess, pruritus, and related conditions. Male prisoners had a significantly higher prevalence of all types of skin diseases than female prisoners. CONCLUSIONS: Skin diseases are common in prisoners in Taiwan. Therefore, early prevention and appropriate treatment are needed. Male-specific skin products are also needed, given the differences in the prevalence of skin diseases among male and female prisoners.","33":"Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is the most common allergic skin disease of horses. It is caused by insect bites of the Culicoides spp. which mediate a type I\/IVb allergy with strong involvement of eosinophil cells. No specific treatment option is available so far. One concept could be the use of a therapeutic antibody targeting equine interleukin 5, the main activator and regulator of eosinophils. Therefore, antibodies were selected by phage display using the naive human antibody gene libraries HAL9\/10, tested in a cellular in vitro inhibition assay and subjected to an in vitro affinity maturation. In total, 28 antibodies were selected by phage display out of which eleven have been found to be inhibiting in the final format as chimeric immunoglobulin G with equine constant domains. The two most promising candidates were further improved by in vitro affinity maturation up to factor 2.5 regarding their binding activity and up to factor 2.0 regarding their inhibition effect. The final antibody named NOL226-2-D10 showed a strong inhibition of the interleukin 5 binding to its receptor (IC(50) = 4 nM). Furthermore, a nanomolar binding activity (EC(50) = 8.8 nM), stable behavior and satisfactory producibility were demonstrated. This antibody is an excellent candidate for in vivo studies for the treatment of equine IBH.","34":"OBJECTIVES: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, may be at an increased risk for malignancies compared with patients without AD; however, incidence rates (IRs) of malignancies in patients with moderate to severe AD are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare IRs of malignancies in adults with moderate to severe AD (aged >\/=18 years). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using data from a Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) cohort. AD severity classification was adjudicated with medical chart review. Covariates and stratification variables included age, sex and smoking status. SETTING: Data were obtained from the KPNC healthcare delivery system in northern California, USA. Cases of AD were defined by outpatient dermatologist-rendered codes and prescriptions of topical therapy or phototherapy (moderate) or systemic treatment (severe). PARTICIPANTS: KPNC health plan members with moderate or severe AD (2007-2018). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Malignancy IRs and 95% CIs per 1000 person-years were calculated. RESULTS: 7050 KPNC health plan members with moderate and severe AD met eligibility criteria for inclusion. IRs (95% CI) were highest for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in patients with moderate and severe AD (4.6 (95% CI 3.9 to 5.5) and 5.9 (95% CI 3.8 to 9.2), respectively) and breast cancer (2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.0) and 0.5 (95% CI 0.1 to 3.9), respectively). Except for breast cancer, which was only evaluated in women, malignancies were higher (with non-overlapping CIs) in patients with moderate and moderate to severe AD in men versus women for basal cell carcinoma and NMSC and in former versus never smokers for NMSC and squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimated IRs of malignancies in patients with moderate and severe AD and provides valuable information for dermatology clinicians and ongoing clinical trials in these populations.","35":"BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of eczema has continued to rise over the past decades. This has led to the emphasis on the association between air pollution and eczema. This study investigated the relationship between daily exposure to air pollution and the number of eczema outpatient visits in Guangzhou with the overarching goal of providing novel insights on the interventions for eczema aggravation and prevention. METHODS: Daily air pollution data, meteorological data, and the number of eczema outpatients were obtained from 18 January 2013 to 31 December 2018 in Guangzhou. A generalized additive model with Poisson distribution was used to assess the association between the number of eczema outpatient visits and short-term exposure to PM(2.5) and PM(10). In addition, the association of PM(2.5) and PM(10) by age (<65 years, >\/=65 years) and gender was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 293,343 eczema outpatient visits were recorded. The obtained results indicated that a 10 mug\/m(3) increase of the same day\/lag 1 day\/lag 2 days PM(2.5) was associated with increments of 2.33%, 1.81%, and 0.95% in eczema outpatient risk, respectively. On the other hand, a 10 mug\/m(3) increase of PM(10) was associated with eczema outpatients risk increments of 1.97%, 1.65%, and 0.98% respectively. Furthermore, the associations of PM on the increment of eczema were similar in the male and female groups. Results obtained after age stratified analyses indicated that the strongest positive association between PM(2.5) exposure and eczema was observed at lag 0 day with the percent changes being 4.72% and 3.34% in <12 years old, >\/=12 and <65 years old, and >\/=65 years old groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to PM(2.5) and PM(10) increases the number of eczema outpatients, especially among children and the elderly. The relationship between air quality trends and hospital resource arrangement should be paid attention to by hospital managers which may aid in disease prevention and lower the health burden.","36":"BACKGROUND: The risk factors for skin injuries remain poorly understood in cancer patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). We herein aimed at exploring the effect of clinical factors on the risk of PICC-related skin injuries. METHODS: We included 1245 cancer patients with PICC from 16 hospitals in Suzhou, China. The study outcome was in-hospital skin injuries, including contact dermatitis, skin (epidermal) stripping, tension injury, allergic dermatitis, skin tear, maceration, folliculitis, and pressure injury. RESULTS: During hospitalization, 274 patients (22.0%) developed skin injuries after prolonged use of an indwelling catheter. Univariable logistic regression analysis identified several risk factors for PICC-related skin injuries; multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors independently and significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the risk of PICC-related skin injuries: body mass index (BMI, >25 kg\/m(2) versus <18.5 kg\/m(2): odds ratio (OR), 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-3.11), skin condition (humid vs normal: OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.62-5.43), skin indentation (OR, 4.67; 95% CI, 3.31-6.58), allergic history (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.21-3.66), history of dermatitis (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.00-9.28), history of eczema (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.20-9.43), catheter insertion site (under elbow vs. upper arm: OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.12-9.90), and PICC maintenance interval (4-5 days vs \u2a7d3 days: OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.50; 5-7 days vs \u2a7d3 days: OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02-0.31; 7-9 days vs \u2a7d3 days: OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.57). CONCLUSIONS: BMI, skin condition, skin indentation, allergic history, history of dermatitis, history of eczema, catheter insertion site, and PICC maintenance interval were independent risk factors for PICC-related skin injuries in cancer patients. This knowledge will guide future studies with formulating optimal treatment strategies for improving the skin health of cancer patients with PICC.","37":"Self-assessment of general health status has a significant influence on patient-related outcomes. The aims of this study were to investigate and compare the level of agreement between patients' and dermatologists' assessments of the severity of chronic hand eczema. From the German registry \"German Chronic Hand Eczema Patient Long-Term Management Registry\" (CARPE), 1,281 pairs of patients with chronic hand eczema and their dermatologists were included. Of these, 788 pairs served as a comparison 2 years after baseline. Concordance analyses found that complete concordance between patients' and dermatologists' assessments were 16.62% at baseline and 11.47% at follow-up. Overall, patients assessed their chronic eczema at baseline as more severe than did the dermatologists; whereas, at follow-up, patients assessed their condition as less severe than the dermatologists' assessment. Bangdiwala's B showed lower values of concordance for womens' and older patients' self-assessment with the dermatologists' assessments. In conclusion, dermatologists should consider the patient's perspective and the individual's assessment of their chronic hand eczema in order to provide effective care in clinical practice.","38":"The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, a Janus kinase 1\/2 inhibitor, for atopic dermatitis (AD) in real-world practice. From August 2021 to September 2022, 36 patients aged >\/=15 years with moderate to severe AD were treated with oral baricitinib 4 mg\/day plus topical corticosteroids. Baricitinib improved clinical indexes; the percent reduction at weeks 4 and 12 was a median of 69.19% and 69.98% for the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), 84.52% and 76.33% for the Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool, and 76.39% and 64.58% for Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Score, respectively. The achievement rate of EASI 75 was 38.89% and 33.33% at weeks 4 and 12, respectively. The percent reduction of EASI in the head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk was 56.9%, 68.3%, 80.7%, and 62.5% at week 12, respectively, with a significant difference between the head and neck versus the lower limbs. Baricitinib decreased thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, lactate dehydrogenase, and total eosinophil count at week 4. Baseline EASI of the head and neck negatively correlated with percent reduction of EASI at week 4, while baseline EASI of the lower limbs positively correlated with percent reduction of EASI at week 12. Treatment-emergent adverse events included elevation of creatine phosphokinase (11.1%), herpes labialis (5.6%), furuncle (8.3%), and exacerbation of AD (1%), without serious treatment-emergent adverse events. In this real-world study, baricitinib was well tolerated for patients with AD and achieved therapeutic effects comparable to those in clinical trials. High baseline EASI of the lower limbs might predict good treatment response at week 12, while high baseline EASI of the head and neck might predict poor treatment response at week 4 in baricitinib treatment for AD.","39":"Highly effective targeted therapies are available to treat non-communicable chronic inflammatory skin diseases (ncISD). In contrast, the exact diagnosis of ncISD is complicated by their complex pathogenesis and clinical and histological overlap. Particularly, differential diagnosis of psoriasis and eczema can be challenging in special cases and molecular diagnostic tools need to be developed to support gold standard diagnosis. Aim of this work was to develop a real-time PCR based molecular classifier to distinguish psoriasis from eczema in FFPE-fixed skin samples and to evaluate the use of minimally invasive microbiopsies and tape strips for molecular diagnosis. Here, we present a FFPE-based molecular classifier (MC) that determines the probability for psoriasis with a sensitivity\/specificity of 92%\/100%, respectively, and an AUC of 0.97 delivering comparable results to our previous published RNAprotect-based MC. The psoriasis probability, as well as levels of NOS2 expression positively correlated with disease hallmarks of psoriasis and negatively with eczema hallmarks. Furthermore, minimally invasive tape strips and microbiopsies were effectively used to differentiate psoriasis from eczema. In summary, the MC offers broad usage in pathology laboratories as well as outpatient settings and can support the differential diagnosis of ncISD on a molecular level FFPE tissue, microbiopsies and tape strips.","40":"Data concerning the economic and humanistic burden in patients with paediatric atopic dermatitis (AD) and their families are scarce. This retrospective study investigated these burdens in paediatric patients with AD using maintenance treatment with topical corticosteroids and\/or conventional systemic immunosuppressants. Patient-reported outcomes regarding quality of life, AD severity, and parental work-related impairment were completed at inclusion. Data on healthcare resource utilization and medication prescription were collected retrospectively over the previous 12 months. Patients were categorized into mild, moderate or severe AD, based on Eczema Area and Severity Index score and medication use. Costs per patient per year per AD severity category were calculated. A total of 101 patients (median age 11.0 years (interquartile range 7.5-14.0), 47.5% men) were included, of whom 38 had mild AD, 37 moderate AD, and 26 severe AD. Mean +\/- standard deviation (SD) total costs patient per year for mild, moderate and severe AD were euro1,812 +\/- euro1,280, euro2,680 +\/- euro3,127, and euro5,861 +\/-  euro3,993, respectively. Highest total direct and indirect costs were found in patients with severe AD, mainly due to higher healthcare and medication costs. Highest humanistic burden was found in patients with moderate AD. For example, the median (interquartile range) Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure score was significantly higher in these patients compared with mild and severe AD (19.0 (15.0-24.0) vs 12.0 (8.8-15.0) and 17.0 (9.5-22.0), respectively). AD in paediatric patients incurs considerable direct and indirect costs, especially in patients with severe AD. The high humanistic burden in patients with moderate AD underlines the need for effective and safe new treatment options for children with AD.","41":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczema-like skin lesions, dry skin, severe itching, and recurrent recurrence. The whey acidic protein four-disulfide core domain gene WFDC12 is highly expressed in skin tissue and up-regulated in the skin lesions of AD patients, but its role and relevant mechanism in AD pathogenesis have not been studied yet. In this study, we found that the expression of WFDC12 was closely related to clinical symptoms of AD and the severity of AD-like lesions induced by DNFB in transgenic mice. WFDC12-overexpressing in the epidermis might promote the migration of skin-presenting cells to lymph nodes and increase Th cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the number and ratio of immune cells and mRNA levels of cytokines were significantly upregulated in transgenic mice. In addition, we found that ALOX12\/15 gene expression was upregulated in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, and the corresponding metabolite accumulation was increased. The activity of epidermal serine hydrolase decreased and the accumulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) increased in the epidermis of transgenic mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that WFDC12 may contribute to the exacerbation of AD-like symptoms in DNFB-induced mouse model by enhancing arachidonic acid metabolism and PAF accumulation and that WFDC12 may be a potential therapeutic target for human atopic dermatitis.","42":"BACKGROUND: Chronic hand and foot eczema is a polyetiological dermatological condition. Patients experience pain, itching, and sleep disturbances and have a reduced quality of life. Skin care programs and patient education can improve the clinical outcome. eHealth devices offer a new opportunity to better inform and monitor patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically analyze the effect of a monitoring smartphone app combined with patient education on the quality of life and clinical outcome of patients with hand and foot eczema. METHODS: Patients in the intervention group received an educational program; attended study visits on weeks 0, 12, and 24; and had access to the study app. Patients in the control group attended the study visits only. The primary end point was a statistically significant reduction in Dermatology Life Quality Index, pruritus, and pain at weeks 12 and 24. The secondary end point was a statistically significant reduction in the modified Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score at weeks 12 and 24. This is an interim analysis at week 24 of the 60-week randomized controlled study. RESULTS: In total, 87 patients were included in the study and randomized to the intervention group (n=43, 49%) or control group (n=44, 51%). Of the 87 patients, 59 (68%) completed the study visit at week 24. There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups regarding quality of life, pain, itch, activity, and clinical outcome at weeks 12 and 24. Subgroup analysis revealed that, compared with the control group, the intervention group with an app use frequency of fewer than once every 5 weeks had a significant improvement in the Dermatology Life Quality Index at weeks 12 (P=.001) and 24 (P=.05), in pain measured on a numeric rating scale at weeks 12 (P=.02) and 24 (P=.02), and in the HECSI score at week 12 (P=.02). In addition, the HECSI scores assessed on the basis of pictures taken by the patients of their hands and feet correlated strongly with the HECSI scores recorded by physicians during regular personal visits (r=0.898; P=.002) even when the quality of the images was not that good. CONCLUSIONS: An educational program combined with a monitoring app that connects patients with their treating dermatologists can improve quality of life if the app is not used too frequently. In addition, telemedical care can at least partially replace personal care in patients with hand and foot eczema because the analysis of the pictures taken by the patients correlates strongly with that of the in vivo images. A monitoring app such as the one presented in this study has the potential to improve patient care and should be implemented in daily practice.

Sleep impairments in children with AD are associated with increased risk of short stature, metabolic syndrome, mental illness and neurocognitive dysfunction. Although the association between AD and sleep disturbance is well established, the specific types of sleep disturbance in pediatric AD patients and their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A scoping literature review was performed to characterize and summarize the types of sleep disturbance in children (less than 18 years of age) with AD. 31 papers met inclusion criteria and extracted data were analyzed in an iterative manner. Two types of sleep disturbances were found to be more prevalent in pediatric AD patients in comparison to controls. One category was related to loss of sleep (increased frequency or duration of awakenings, increased sleep fragmentation, delayed sleep onset, decreased total sleep duration, and decreased sleep efficiency). Another category was associated with unusual behaviors during sleep (restlessness\/limb movement\/scratching, sleep-disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea and snoring, nightmares, nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal hyperhidrosis). Some mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances include pruritus and induced scratching and increased proinflammatory markers induced by sleep loss. Sleep disturbance appears to be associated with AD. We recommend clinicians to consider interventions that may reduce sleep disturbances in children with AD. Further investigation of these sleep disturbances is needed to elucidate pathophysiology, develop additional treatments, and reduce negative impacts on the health outcomes and quality of life in pediatric AD patients.","44":"BACKGROUND: TikTok gives its users a platform to share and view short videos on a wide range of topics, including dermatology related topics. This project sought to analyze the sources of TikTok videos associated with the treatment of four dermatologic conditions and to report the percentage of videos posted by board-certified dermatologists. METHODS: On July 16th, 2021, an investigator input the following hashtags into the TikTok application&rsquo;s search bar: #AcneTreatment, #EczemaTreatment, #PsoriasisTreatment, and #RosaceaTreatment. After the total of 400 videos was obtained, the videos were then classified into the following categories based on the user posting the video: dermatologist, dermatology resident, non-dermatologist physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, esthetician, patient, beauty blogger, and other. Videos that were not in English, paid advertisements or by a business page, and\/or unrelated to treatment or education of a dermatologic condition were excluded. RESULTS: The top posters of all the videos analyzed were patients (40.8%) followed by dermatologists (16.8%). Of all the videos analyzed, 37.3% were posted by licensed professionals and the remaining 62.7% were posted by non-licensed posters. The licensed professionals mostly posted about acne (52.4%) out of the four conditions. Non-professional posters mostly posted about psoriasis (86.7%) and eczema (66.7%) out of the four conditions. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more dermatologist-created, educational content on TikTok and other platforms to increase the likelihood that users will interact with dermatologic content posted by board-certified dermatologists.

When pesticides are used, the over-application and excess discharge into water bodies during rainfall often lead to death of fish and other aquatic life. Even when the fishes still live, their consumption by humans may lead to the biomagnification of chemicals in the body system and can cause deadly diseases, such as cancer, kidney diseases, diabetes, liver dysfunction, eczema, neurological destruction, cardiovascular diseases, and so on. Equally, synthetic pesticides harm the soil texture, soil microbes, animals, and plants. The dangers associated with the use of synthetic pesticides have necessitated the need for alternative use of organic pesticides (biopesticides), which are cheaper, environment friendly, and sustainable. Biopesticides can be sourced from microbes (e.g., metabolites), plants (e.g., from their exudates, essential oil, and extracts from bark, root, and leaves), and nanoparticles of biological origin (e.g., silver and gold nanoparticles). Unlike synthetic pesticides, microbial pesticides are specific in action, can be easily sourced without the need for expensive chemicals, and are environmentally sustainable without residual effects. Phytopesticides have myriad of phytochemical compounds that make them exhibit various mechanisms of action, likewise, they are not associated with the release of greenhouse gases and are of lesser risks to human health compared to the available synthetic pesticides. Nanobiopesticides have higher pesticidal activity, targeted or controlled release with top-notch biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this review, we examined the different types of pesticides, the merits, and demerits of synthetic pesticides and biopesticides, but more importantly, we x-rayed appropriate and sustainable approaches to improve the acceptability and commercial usage of microbial pesticides, phytopesticides, and nanobiopesticides for plant nutrition, crop protection\/yield, animal\/human health promotion, and their possible incorporation into the integrated pest management system.","46":"BACKGROUND: Hand eczema (HE) is a highly prevalent, recurrent, and multifactorial disease. It encompasses a group of eczematous diseases that affect the hands, etiologically classified into irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). Few epidemiological studies in Latin America have investigated the characteristics of patients with this condition and the origin of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the profile of patients diagnosed with HE submitted to patch tests aiming to determine its etiology. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out on epidemiological data and patch tests of patients with HE treated at a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo from January 2013 to December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were studied, whose final diagnosis was 61.8% of ICD, 23.1% of ACD and 5.2% of AD, with diagnostic overlap in 42.8% of the cases. The main positive and relevant patch tests were: Kathon CG (42%), nickel sulfate (33%), and thiuram mix (18%). STUDY LIMITATIONS: The number of treated cases and socioeconomic profile was limited to a vulnerable population group. CONCLUSION: HE is a diagnosis in which overlapping etiologies are frequent, with the main sensitizers identified in ACD being Kathon CG, nickel sulfate and thiuram mix.","47":"Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are caused by monogenic variants that affect the host response to bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. As such, individuals with IEI often present with severe, recurrent, and life-threatening infections. However, the spectrum of disease due to IEI is very broad and extends to include autoimmunity, malignancy, and atopic diseases such as eczema, atopic dermatitis, and food and environmental allergies. Here, I review IEI that affect cytokine signaling pathways that dysregulate CD4(+) T-cell differentiation, resulting in increased T-helper-2 (Th2) cell development, function, and pathogenicity. These are elegant examples of how rare IEI can provide unique insights into more common pathologies such as allergic disease that are impacting the general population at increased frequency.","48":"AIM: To describe clinical presentation and development of tolerance among children with Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) in a population in northern Sweden. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of children presenting with FPIES symptoms from 1 January 2004, to 31 May 2018. RESULTS: Sixty children (65% boys) with FPIES were included. The estimated incidence gradually increased to 0.45% in 2016-2017. The most common food triggers were cow's milk (40%), fish (37%) and oat (23%). Symptoms presented in 31 (60%) children before 6 months and in 57 (95%) before 1 year of age. The median age for FPIES diagnosis was 7 (range 3-134) months and for fish FPIES 13 (range 7-134) months. By 3 years of age, 67% of children with FPIES to milk and oat but none of the children with fish FPIES had developed tolerance. Allergic conditions like eczema and asthma were reported in 52% of the children. CONCLUSION: The cumulative FPIES incidence was 0.45% in 2016-2017. Most children presented with symptoms before 1 year of age, but the diagnosis was often delayed, especially for FPIES to fish. Tolerance development occurred at an earlier age when FPIES was triggered by milk and oat compared to fish.","49":"There is limited information on the use of websites and social media platforms among dermatology patients. This survey study of 210 children with atopic dermatitis and their caretakers who attended dermatology clinic from 6\/1\/2020 through 5\/1\/2021 revealed that 83.8% had used online sources for information related to their condition. There was wide variation in the sources used and the participants' perceived trustworthiness of these. This study highlights the importance of physicians actively engaging with the online sources used by patients with atopic dermatitis and their caregivers during counseling in clinic.","50":"Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX) is a serious disorder, which may comprise diabetes, thyroid disease, enteropathy, cytopenias, eczema, and other multi-system autoimmune dysfunction features. IPEX syndrome is caused by mutations in the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) gene. Here, we report the clinical manifestations of a patient with IPEX syndrome onset in the neonatal period. A de novo mutation at exon 11 of the FOXP3 gene (c.1190G > A, p.R397Q) was found, and its main clinical manifestations included hyperglycemia and hypothyroidism. Subsequently, we comprehensively reviewed the clinical characteristics and FOXP3 mutations of 55 reported neonatal IPEX cases. The most frequent clinical presentation included symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement (n = 51, 92.7%), followed by skin-related symptoms (n = 37, 67.3%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (n = 33, 60.0%), elevated IgE (n = 28, 50.9%), hematological abnormality (n = 23, 41.8%), thyroid dysfunction (n = 18, 32.7%), and kidney-related symptoms (n = 13, 23.6%). In total, 38 variants were observed in the 55 neonatal patients. The most frequent mutation was c.1150G > A (n = 6; 10.9%), followed by c.1189C > T (n = 4; 7.3%), c.816 + 5G > A (n = 3; 5.5%), and C.1015C > G (n = 3; 5.5%), which were reported more than twice. The genotype-phenotype relationship showed that the repressor domain mutations were associated with DM (P = 0.020), and the leucine zipper mutations were associated with nephrotic syndrome (P = 0.020). The survival analysis suggested that treatment with glucocorticoids increased the survival of the neonatal patients. This literature review provides an informative reference for the diagnosis and treatment of IPEX syndrome in the neonatal period.","51":"BACKGROUND: Dose reduction (DR) of adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab has proven to be (cost-)effective in psoriasis patients with low disease activity. Further implementation is needed to establish application of DR for eligible patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the implementation of protocolized biologic DR in daily practice. METHODS: A pilot implementation study was performed in 3 hospitals during 6 months. By combining education and protocol development, involved healthcare providers (HCPs) were directed toward the adoption of protocolized DR. DR of adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab was achieved by stepwise injection interval prolongation. Implementation outcomes (fidelity, feasibility) were assessed. Factors for optimizing implementation were explored in interviews with HCPs. Uptake was measured in patients by chart review. RESULTS: The implementation strategy was executed as planned. Implementation fidelity was less than 100% as not all provided tools were used across study sites. HCPs indicated the feasibility of implementing protocolized DR, although time investment was needed. Identified additional factors for successful implementation included support for patients, uptake of DR into guidelines, and supportive electronic health record systems. During the 6 months intervention period, 52 patients were eligible for DR of whom 26 (50%) started DR. The proposed DR protocol was followed in 22\/26 patients (85%) on DR. CONCLUSION: Additional staff for support, extra time during consultations, education on DR for HCPs and patients, and effective tools such as a feasible protocol can lead to more patients on biologic DR.","52":"This study aimed to clarify the psychosocial difficulties and impacts that cancer patients face from appearance changes, in order to develop a patient support program. An online survey was administered to patients registered with an online survey company who met the eligibility criteria. The study population was randomly selected from gender and cancer types to create a sample that reflected the proportion of cancer incidence rates in Japan as much as possible. Out of a total of 1034 respondents, 601patients (58.1%) experienced appearance change. Symptoms that were reported to have a high distress level and prevalence rate, and that widely required provision of information were such as alopecia (22.2%), edema (19.8%) and eczema (17.8%). Distress levels and personal assistance requirements were high particularly for patients who experienced stoma placement and mastectomy. More than 40% of patients who experienced appearance change had quit or were absent from work or school, and reported that their social activities were negatively affected by the visually notable changes in their appearance. Concerns about \"receiving pity from others\" or about \"the exposure of cancer\" due to their appearance change also led patients to reduce outings (beta = 0.32 and beta = 0.31 respectively, p < 0.001) and social interactions with others (beta = 0.34 and beta = 0.36 respectively, p < 0.001) and increased the discord in human relationships (beta = 0.21 and beta = 0.19 respectively, p < 0.001). Results from this study indicate the areas in which more support is required from healthcare professionals, as well as the need for interventions for patient cognition to avoid maladaptive behaviors in cancer patients who experience appearance changes.","53":"Genetic variants in filaggrin (FLG) are key in eczema and are less common in Africans than in Europeans and Asians. Here we examined the association between FLG Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and eczema in a population of admixed Brazilian children and whether African ancestry modifies this association. We included 1010 controls and 137 cases and ran logistic regressions between SNPs in FLG and eczema in the studied population and also stratified the analyses according to the degree of African ancestry. In addition, we tested the replication of the findings on an independent set of individuals, as well as, we verified the impact on FLG expression according to each SNP genotype. The T allele of SNP rs6587666 was negatively associated with eczema in additive model (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.93, P: 0.017). Moreover, African ancestry modifies the association between rs6587666 and eczema. The effect of the T allele was higher among individuals with higher African ancestry and the association with eczema was lost in individuals with lower African ancestry. In our analyses the expression of FLG in skin was slightly downregulated by the presence of the T allele of rs6587666. In our population, the T allele of rs6587666 in FLG was associated with protection to eczema and the degree of African ancestry was able to modify the observed association.","54":null,"55":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f. is widely used in various traditional systems of medicine worldwide. Since over 5000 years ago, several cultures have used A. vera extract medicinally for conditions ranging from diabetes to eczema. It has been shown to reduce the symptoms of diabetes by enhancing insulin secretion and protecting pancreatic islets. AIM OF THE WORK: This research study aimed to investigate the in-vitro antioxidant effect, the acute oral toxicity, and the possible pharmacological in-vivo anti-diabetic activity with histological examination of the pancreas of the standardized deep red A. vera flowers methanolic extracts (AVFME). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The liquid-liquid extraction procedure and TLC technique were used to investigate chemical composition. Total phenolics and flavonoids in AVFME were quantified by Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl(3) colorimetric methods, respectively. The present study involved evaluating the in-vitro antioxidant effect of AVFME using ascorbic acid as the reference standard, an acute oral toxicity study by using thirty-six albino rats and different concentrations of AVFME (200 mg\/kg, 2, 4, 8 and 10 g\/kg b.w.). Furthermore, the in-vivo anti-diabetic study was performed on alloxan-induced diabetes in rats (120 mg\/kg, I.P.) and two doses of AVFME (200 and 500 mg\/kg b.w., orally) were used as compared to glibenclamide (5 mg\/kg, orally) as a standard hypoglycemic sulfonylurea medication. A histological examination of the pancreas was performed. RESULTS: AVFME resulted in the highest phenolic content of 150.44 +\/- 4.62 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram (GAE\/g) along with flavonoid content of 70.38 +\/- 0.97 mg of quercetin equivalent per gram (QE\/g). An in-vitro study revealed that the antioxidant effect of AVFME was strong as ascorbic acid. The results of the in-vivo studies showed that the AVFME didn't cause any apparent toxicity signs or death in all groups at different doses which proves the safety of this extract with a wide therapeutic index. The antidiabetic activity of AVFME demonstrated a considerable drop in blood glucose levels as glibenclamide, without severe hypoglycemia or significant weight gain which is considered an advantage of AVFME over glibenclamide use. The histopathological study of pancreatic tissues confirmed the protective effect of AVFME on the pancreatic beta-cells. The extract is proposed to have antidiabetic activity through inhibition of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Molecular docking studies were conducted to understand possible molecular interactions with these enzymes. CONCLUSION: AVFME represents a promising alternative source of active constituents against diabetes mellitus (DM) based on its oral safety, antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic activities, and pancreatic protective effects. These data revealed the antihyperglycemic activity of AVFME is mediated by pancreatic protective effects while significantly enhancing insulin secretion through increasing functioning beta cells. This suggests that AVFME has the potential as a novel antidiabetic therapy or a dietary supplement for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM).","56":"Background: There is a high demand for dermatological care in Germany. As use of teledermatology has increased significantly, this study aimed to investigate the impact of teledermatology on patient care. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from a direct-to-consumer teledermatology platform using store-and-forward technology available in Germany between July 2021 and April 2022. Additional patient characteristics were collected using a voluntary follow-up questionnaire, 28 days after teleconsultation. Results: Data of 1,999 enrolled patients were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 36 years, and 61.2% (1,223\/1,999) lived in a rural residence. The most common diagnoses included eczema (36.0%, 701\/1,946), fungal diseases (15.4%, 299\/1,946), and acne (12.5%, 243\/1,946). The follow-up questionnaire was answered by 166 patients (8.3%, 166\/1,999). In total, 42.8% (71\/166) of patients had undergone no previous medical consultation. The most frequent reason for using teledermatology was the waiting time for a dermatology outpatient appointment (62.0%, 103\/166). A total of 62.0% (103\/166) participants rated the treatment success as good or very good, while 86.1% (143\/166) rated the quality of telemedical care as equal or better to that of an outpatient visit. Conclusion: This study showed that patients often use teledermatology because of functional barriers (waiting times). In this cohort, the diagnoses strongly corresponded to reasons for outpatient presentation. Most patients rated the quality of teledermatology service as at least equivalent to that of outpatient physician visits and reported treatment success. Thus, teledermatology can relieve the burden of outpatient care while providing high benefits from the patient's perspective.","57":"The aim of this multi-centre French retrospective study was to identify severe, i.e. crusted and profuse, scabies patients. Records were retrieved from 22 Dermatology or Infectious Diseases departments in the Ile-de-France from January 2009 to January 2015 to characterize epidemiology, demography, diagnosis, contributing factors, treatment features, and outcomes in severe scabies. A total of 95 inpatients (57 crusted and 38 profuse) were included. A higher number of cases was observed among elderly patients (>75 years), mostly living in institutions. Thirteen patients (13.6%) reported a history of previously treated scabies. Sixty-three patients (66.3%) had been seen by a previous practitioner for the current episode (up to 8 previous visits). Initial misdiagnosis (e.g. eczema, prurigo, drug-related eruptions, psoriasis) was documented in 41 patients (43.1%). Fifty-eight patients (61%) had already received 1 or more previous treatments for their current episode. Forty percent received corticosteroids or acitretin for an initial diagnosis of eczema or psoriasis. Median time from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of severe scabies was 3 months (range 0.3-22). Itch was present in all patients at diagnosis. Most patients (n=84, 88.4%) had comorbidities. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches varied. Complications occurred in 11.5% of cases. To date, there is no consensus for diagnosis and treatment, and future standardization of is required for optimal management.","58":"Previous literature has explored unconscious racial biases in clinical education and medicine, finding that people with darker skin tones can be underrepresented in learning resources and managed differently in a clinical setting. This study aimed to examine whether patient skin colour can affect the diagnostic ability and confidence of medical students, and their cognitive reasoning processes. We presented students with 12 different clinical presentations on both white skin (WS) and non-white skin (NWS). A think aloud (TA) study was conducted to explore students' cognitive reasoning processes (n = 8). An online quiz was also conducted where students submitted a diagnosis and confidence level for each clinical presentation (n = 185). In the TA interviews, students used similar levels of information gathering and analytical reasoning for each skin type but appeared to display increased uncertainty and reduced non-analytical reasoning methods for the NWS images compared to the WS images. In the online quiz, students were significantly more likely to accurately diagnose five of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema and meningococcal disease) on WS compared to NWS (p < 0.01). With regards to students' confidence, they were significantly more confident diagnosing eight of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema, meningococcal disease, urticaria, chickenpox and Kawasaki disease) on WS when compared to NWS (p < 0.01). These findings highlight the need to improve teaching resources to include a greater diversity of skin colours exhibiting clinical signs, to improve students' knowledge and confidence, and ultimately, to avoid patients being misdiagnosed due to the colour of their skin.","59":"Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent eczema and intense pruritus, is a major skin-related burden worldwide. The diagnosis and treatment of AD is often challenging due to the high heterogeneity of AD, and its exact etiology is unknown. Metabolomics offers the opportunity to follow continuous physiological and pathological changes in individuals, which allows accurate diagnosis and management as well as providing deep insights into the etiopathogenesis of AD. Several metabolomic studies of AD have been published over the past few years. The aim of this review is to summarize these findings and help researchers to understand the rapid development of metabolomics for AD. A comprehensive and systematic search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. Twenty-six papers were finally included in the review after quality assessment. Significant differences in metabolite profiles were found between patients with AD and healthy individuals. This study provides a comprehensive overview of metabolomic research in AD. A better understanding of the metabolomics of AD may offer novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches.","60":"Alcobiosis, the symbiosis of algae and corticioid fungi, frequently occurs on bark and wood. Algae form a layer in or below fungal basidiomata reminiscent of the photobiont layer in lichens. Identities of algal and fungal partners were confirmed by DNA barcoding. Algal activity was examined using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. Carbon transfer from algae to fungi was detected as (13)C, assimilated by algae, transferred to the fungal polyol. Nine fungal partners scattered across Agaricomycetes are associated with three algae from Trebouxiophycae: Coccomyxa sp. with seven fungal species on damp wood, Desmococcus olivaceus and Tritostichococcus coniocybes, both with a single species on bark and rain-sheltered wood, respectively. The fungal partner does not cause any obvious harm to the algae. Algae enclosed in fungal tissue exhibited a substantial CO(2) uptake, but carbon transfer to fungal tissues was only detected in the Lyomyces-Desmococcus alcobiosis where some algal cells are tightly enclosed by hyphae in goniocyst-like structures. Unlike lichen mycobionts, fungi in alcobioses are not nutritionally dependent on the algal partner as all of them can live without algae. We consider alcobioses to be symbioses in various stages of co-evolution, but still quite different from true lichens.","61":"INTRODUCTION: Our aim is to investigate whether a shortened digital self-care intervention is non-inferior to, and cost-effective compared with, a comprehensive and therapist-guided cognitive behavioural therapy treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-blind, randomised clinical non-inferiority trial at Karolinska Institutet, a medical university in Stockholm, Sweden. We will recruit 174 adult participants with AD through self-referral. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to the two experimental conditions. Participants randomised to guided care will receive internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for 12 weeks. Participants randomised to digital self-care will have access to this self-guided intervention for 12 weeks. At post-treatment (primary endpoint), non-inferiority will be tested and resource use will be compared between the two treatment groups. Cost-effectiveness will be explored at 1-year follow-up. Potential mediators will be investigated. Data will be analysed intention to treat. We define non-inferiority as a three-point difference on the primary outcome measure (Patient-oriented Eczema Measure). Recruitment started in November 2022. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Swedish ethics authority (reg. no 2021-06704-01) and is preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological trials. The results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and disseminated to patient organisations and media.

HFMD is characterized by a brief febrile illness in children and with a typical skin rash of the hand and foot, with or without mouth ulcers. However, the morphology and distribution of vesicles, as well as accompanying symptoms, are varied among atypical HFMD. An upsurge in atypical presentations of HFMD caused by Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), including Gianotti-Crosti-like eruptions, eczema coxsackium, petechial\/purpuric eruption, and vesiculobullous exanthema, can be difficult to diagnose clinically as it may mimic other severe skin diseases, such as eczema herpeticum, varicella, disseminated zoster, and erythema multiforme major. The recognition of the distinguishing features of atypical HFMD is vital for an accurate and timely diagnosis, as is initiating appropriate laboratory evaluation and supportive care. Clinicians must identify the wide range of cutaneous and mucosal alterations caused by atypical HFMD. A systemic, high-quality overview of atypical HFMD is needed for advances in better strategies for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Hence, this review is aimed at summarizing the available data on clinical investigations and differential diagnostics to provide a scientific guide for the timely diagnosis of HFMD for preventing serious complications.","63":"The pathogenesis-related protein-1 (PR1) gene is important for plants to respond to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Unlike those in model plants, PR1 genes in wheat have not been systematically studied. Herein, we identified 86 potential TaPR1 wheat genes using bioinformatics tools and RNA sequencing. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that the TaPR1 genes were involved in the salicylic acid signalling pathway, MAPK signalling pathway, and phenylalanine metabolism in response to Pst-CYR34 infection. Ten of the TaPR1 genes were structurally characterized and validated by RT\u2012PCR. One particular gene, TaPR1-7, was found to be associated with resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) in a biparental wheat population. Virus-induced gene silencing showed that TaPR1-7 is important for Pst resistance in wheat. This study provides the first comprehensive study on wheat PR1 genes, improving our overall understanding of these genes in plant defenses, particularly against stripe rust.","64":null,"65":"Health care spending in Italy is high and continues to increase; assessing the long-term health and economic outcomes of new therapies is essential. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, pruritic, immune-mediated inflammatory dermatosis, a clinical condition that significantly affects patients' quality of life at a high cost and requires continuous care. This retrospective study aimed to assess the direct cost and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of Dupilumab and patients' clinical outcomes. All AD patients treated with Dupilumab at the Sassari University Hospital, Italy, between January 2019 and December 2021 were included. Eczema Area Severity Index, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and Itch Numeric Rating Scale scores were measured. ADRs and drug expenses were analyzed. A statistically significant posttreatment improvement was observed for all the indices measured: EASI (P < 0.0001), DLQI (P < 0.0001), NRS (P < 0.0001). The total expenditure for Dupilumab, in the observed period, amounted to euro 589.748,66 for 1358 doses, and a positive correlation was shown between annual expenditure and delta percentage of variation pre- and posttreatment for the clinical parameters evaluated.","66":"BACKGROUND: Hyperlinear palms are described as a feature of loss-of-function (LoF) variants in Filaggrin (FLG). OBJECTIVE: To explore the phenotype of participants (age <31 years) with atopic eczema of Bangladeshi ancestry from East London and investigate which factors best associate with LoF FLG variants. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with participants recruited between May 2018 and March 2020. Patterns of palmar linearity were categorised and modelled with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration (SH) and LoF FLG variants. RESULTS: Five hundred and six complete cases were available. Five palm patterns were noted. The 'prominent diamond' pattern associated best with EASI (marginal effects [ME], 2.53, 95% CI 1.74-3.67), TEWL (ME 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.62) and SH (ME 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.96). Using five palm patterns had some ability to discriminate LoF FLG variants (area under the receiver operator characteristic [AUROC] 76.07; 95% CI 71.58-80.57), improving in subgroup analysis with only fine perpendicular\/prominent diamond patterns and SH (AUROC 89.11%; 95% CI 84.02-94.19). LIMITATIONS: Single centre study design with humans classifying clinical patterns. Stability of temperature and humidity not guaranteed across TEWL and SH measurements despite using a climate controlled room. CONCLUSION: Palm patterns associate with EASI and TEWL. The fine perpendicular\/prominent diamond patterns are markers to detect absence\/presence of LoF FLG variants respectively.","67":"BACKGROUND: It is not fully understood how different degrees of improvements in atopic dermatitis (AD) clinical outcome measures translate to improvements in patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, such as those assessing itch, symptoms, sleep, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), and work productivity. OBJECTIVES: This post hoc analysis of three clinical studies assessed how more robust improvements in clinical responses are associated with improvements in PROs and QoL. METHODS: Data from 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2, and AD Up) were included. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to upadacitinib (15 or 30 mg) or placebo once daily (alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids). The mean percentage improvement from baseline to week 16 and percentage of patients achieving responses at week 16 were summarized by the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and validated Investigator Global Assessment of Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) response level categories. RESULTS: A total of 2392 patients from the 3 trials were included in the analysis. Increasingly greater mean percentage improvement and proportion of patients achieving response was observed at higher clinical response levels (ie, stepwise pattern). Mean percentage improvement and proportion of patients achieving response exceeded 69% and 70% at EASI >\/=90 and vIGA-AD 0\/1, respectively, for most PROs including Worst Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale, Patient Oriented Eczema Measure, and Dermatology Life Quality Index. CONCLUSIONS: Greater degrees of clinical responses are related to more robust improvements across multiple dimensions impacted by AD, including itch, skin pain, sleep, anxiety, depression, and quality of life.","68":"The entry of peptides into glycobiology has led to the development of a unique class of therapeutic tools. Although numerous and well-known peptides are active as endocrine regulatory factors that bind to specific receptors, and peptides have been used extensively as epitopes for vaccine production, the use of peptides that mimic sugars as ligands of lectin-type receptors has opened a unique approach to modulate activity of immune cells. Ground-breaking work that initiated the use of peptides as tools for therapy identified sugar mimetics by screening phage display libraries. The peptides that have been discovered show significant potential as high-avidity, therapeutic tools when synthesized as multivalent structures. Advantages of peptides over sugars as drugs for immune modulation will be illustrated in this review.","69":"Skin inflammation is a symptom of many skin diseases, such as eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis, which cause rashes, redness, heat, or blistering. The use of natural products with anti-inflammatory properties has gained importance in treating these symptoms. Ursolic acid (UA), a promising natural compound that is used to treat skin diseases, exhibits low aqueous solubility, resulting in poor absorption and low bioavailability. Designing topical formulations focuses on providing adequate delivery via application to the skin surface. The aim of this study was to formulate and characterize lipid-surfactant-based systems for the delivery of UA. Microemulsions and liquid crystalline systems (LCs) were characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), rheology techniques, and textural and bioadhesive assays. PLM supported the self-assembly of these systems and elucidated their formation. Rheologic examination revealed pseudoplastic and thixotropic behavior appropriate, and assays confirmed the ability of these formulations to adhere to the skin. In vivo studies were performed, and inflammation induced by croton oil was assessed for response to microemulsions and LCs. UA anti-inflammatory activities of ~60% and 50% were demonstrated by two microemulsions and 40% and 35% by two LCs, respectively. These data support the continued development of colloidal systems to deliver UA to ameliorate skin inflammation.","70":"Changes in household endotoxin concentration may affect the prognosis of food allergy (FA), but data on the association between household endotoxin concentration and an already-developed FA are scarce. Thus, we investigated the association between environmental endotoxin exposure and tolerance to hen's egg (HE) and cow's milk (CM) using data from children participating in the Japan Environment and Children's Study who had HE allergies (n = 204) and CM allergy (n = 72) in their first year of life. We grouped the endotoxin results into quartiles 1-4 (Q1-Q4). In children with HE allergy and with CM allergy, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of tolerance to HE and CM at 2 years old when comparing endotoxin levels of the children in Q1 with those in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. However, subgroup analyses by the presence of eczema and causal foods revealed that children in Q1 had a lower prevalence of tolerance to foods in some subgroup analyses and lower causal allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 levels. Although an individually based approach against endotoxin according to background characteristics, such as eczema and causal foods, is necessary, preventing excessive endotoxin removal might contribute to FA resolution in some children.","71":"Tauhe importance of the gut microbiome and its functions has only recently been recognized and researched in greater depth. The establishment of the human gut microbiome begins in utero, forming its adult-like phenotype in the first 2-3 years of life. Several factors affect and alter the gut microbiome composition and its metabolic functions, such as early onset of breastfeeding, mode of delivery, antibiotic administration, or exposure to chemical substances, among others. Existing data support the important connection between health status and gut microbiome homeostasis. In cases when this balance is disturbed, several disorders may arise, such as inflammatory reactions that lead to atopy, eczema, or allergic asthma. The so-called gut-brain axis refers to the complex biochemical pathways between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system. One of the most fascinating areas of ongoing research is the broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and how gut health may be associated with such disorders. The prevalence of NDDs, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has increased over recent years. Whether gut microbiota homeostasis plays a role in these disorders is not yet fully understood. The aim of this narrative review is to provide an account of current knowledge on how gut health is linked with these disorders. We performed a literature review in order to identify and synthesize available data that highlights the potential association between NDDs and a balanced gut microbiome in terms of composition and proper function. The connection between the gut microbiome and NDDs offers promising new opportunities for future research.","72":"An intense effort has been focused on new therapeutic approaches and the development of technologies for more efficient and rapid wound healing. The research for plants used for long time in traditional medicine in the treatment of wound has become a promising strategy to obtain drugs therapeutically useful in the acute and chronic wound management. In this context, Centella asiatica (Apiaceae) has been used to treat a variety of skin diseases, such as leprosy, lupus, varicose ulcers, eczema and psoriasis, in Asiatic traditional medicine for thousands of years. Studies have shown that Centella asiatica extracts (CAE) display activity in tissue regeneration, cell migration and wound repair process by promoting fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. Preliminary findings have shown that the asiatic acid is one of the main active constituents of C. asiatica, directly associated with its healing activity. Thus, this study discusses aspects of the effects of Centella asiatica and its active component, asiatic acid, in different stages of the healing process of cutaneous wounds, including phytochemical and antimicrobial aspects that contribute to its therapeutic potential.","73":"BACKGROUND: Tight junctions are transmembrane proteins that regulate the permeability of water, solutes including ions, and water-soluble molecules. The objective of this systematic review is to focus on the current knowledge regarding the role of tight junctions in atopic dermatitis and the possible impact on their therapeutic potential. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library between 2009 and 2022. After evaluation of the literature and taking into consideration their content, 55 articles were finally included. RESULTS: TJs' role in atopic dermatitis extends from a microscopic scale to having macroscopic effects, such as increased susceptibility to pathogens and infections and worsening of atopic dermatitis features. Impaired TJ barrier function and skin permeability in AD lesions is correlated with cldn-1 levels. Th2 inflammation inhibits the expression of cldn-1 and cldn-23. Scratching has also been reported to decrease cldn-1 expression. Dysfunctional TJs' interaction with Langerhans cells could increase allergen penetration. Susceptibility to cutaneous infections in AD patients could also be affected by TJ cohesion. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunction of TJs and their components, especially claudins, have a significant role in the pathogenesis and vicious circle of inflammation in AD. Discovering more basic science data regarding TJ functionality may be the key for the use of specific\/targeted therapies in order to improve epidermal barrier function in AD.","74":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers, particularly nurses and apprentice nurses, are at high risk of the development of hand eczema due to daily exposure to wet work. This study aimed to assess the occurrence of hand eczema in a group of first-, second-, and third-year apprentice nurses at the University Hospitals of Trieste (northeastern Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two hundred forty-two Nursing School students were recruited. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire based on the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire, and all patients underwent a medical examination to evaluate their skin condition based on standard scores. Transepidermal water loss was also measured. The factors associated with hand eczema were investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of hand eczema was low in students both before and after the traineeship (17.9 and 21.5%, respectively), but clinical signs of mild skin damage, mainly skin dryness, were present in 52.3 and 47.2%, respectively. The factor associated with hand eczema was a personal history of atopic eczema (odd ratios 2.61, 95% confidence intervals 1.18-5.80), while exposure to irritants and glove use did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings might be explained by the preventive measures adopted for skin protection among healthcare workers in Trieste since the apprenticeship.","75":"The worldwide prevalence of asthma in children is variable. The different epidemiological definitions of asthma, the use of various methods of measurement, and the environmental variations between countries are responsible for such different prevalence rates. This study has been performed to identify the prevalence\/risk factors of asthma in Saudi children\/adolescents in Rabigh. A cross-sectional epidemiological survey has been conducted using the validated Arabic version of the \"International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire\". Data on the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and risk factors of asthma have also been collected. Three hundred and forty-nine Children\/adolescents with an age range of 5-18 years have been randomly selected for an interview from public places and houses in different regions of Rabigh City. The prevalence rates of physician-diagnosed asthma, any wheezing, and wheezing in the last 12 months among children\/adolescents (mean age: 12.22 +\/- 4.14 years) have remarkably increased in association with the rapidly developing industrialization of Rabigh from previously recorded rates of 4.9%, 7.4%, and 6.4% in the only study that has previously been conducted in Rabigh in 1998 to 31.5%, 23.5%, and 14.9%, respectively. The univariate analysis has detected some significant risk factors for asthma. However, in younger aged children (5-9 years), allergic rhinitis, associated chronic illnesses, and viral respiratory infection-induced wheezing have remained significant risk factors of any wheezing. Drug allergy, exposure to dust, and viral respiratory infection-induced wheezing have persisted as significant risk factors for wheezing in the last 12 months. Eczema in the family, exposure to perfumes\/incense, and viral respiratory infection-induced wheezing have remained as significant risk factors of physician-diagnosed asthma. The results of this survey should be useful in future targeted preventive plans\/measures with special attention to improving air quality to limit the progressive increase in asthma prevalence in Rabigh, as well as in other similar industrial communities.","76":"Autoimmune diseases often present with cutaneous symptoms that contribute to dysfunction, disfigurement, and in many cases, reduced quality-of-life. Unfortunately, treatment options for many autoimmune skin diseases are limited. Local and systemic corticosteroids remain the current standard-of-care but are associated with significant adverse effects. Hence, there is an unmet need for novel therapies that block molecular drivers of disease in a local and\/or targeted manner. Granzyme B (GzmB) is a serine protease with known cytotoxic activity and emerging extracellular functions, including the cleavage of cell-cell junctions, basement membranes, cell receptors, and other structural proteins. While minimal to absent in healthy skin, GzmB is markedly elevated in alopecia areata, interface dermatitis, pemphigoid disease, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, and vitiligo. This review will discuss the role of GzmB in immunity, blistering, apoptosis, and barrier dysfunction in the context of autoimmune skin disease. GzmB plays a causal role in the development of pemphigoid disease and carries diagnostic and prognostic significance in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, and alopecia areata. Taken together, these data support GzmB as a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune skin diseases impacted by impaired barrier function, inflammation, and\/or blistering.","77":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is known as a skin disease; however, T cell immunopathology found in blood is associated with its severity. Skin Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and associated host-pathogen dynamics are important to chronic T helper 2 (Th2)-dominated inflammation in AD, yet they remain poorly understood. This study sought to investigate the effects of S. aureus-derived molecules and skin alarmins on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, specifically testing Th2-type cells, cytokines, and chemokines known to be associated with AD. We first show that six significantly elevated Th2-related chemokine biomarkers distinguish blood from adult AD patients compared to healthy controls ex vivo; in addition, TARC\/CCL17, LDH, and PDGF-AA\/AB correlated significantly with disease severity. We then demonstrate that these robust AD-associated biomarkers, as well as associated type 2 T cell functions, are readily reproduced from healthy blood mononuclear cells exposed to the alarmin TSLP and the S. aureus superantigen SEB in a human in vitro model, including IL-13, IL-5, and TARC secretion as well as OX-40-expressing activated memory T cells. We further show that the agonism of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)2 inhibits this IL-13 secretion and memory Th2 and Tc2 cell functional activation while inducing significantly increased pSTAT3 and IL-6, both critical for Th17 cell responses. These findings identify NOD2 as a potential regulator of type 2 immune responses in humans and highlight its role as an endogenous inhibitor of pathogenic IL-13 that may open avenues for its therapeutic targeting in AD.","78":"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests maternal pregnancy dietary intake and nutrition in the early postnatal period to be of importance for the newborn child's health. However, studies investigating diet-related metabolites transferred from mother to child on disease risk in childhood are lacking. We sought to investigate the influence of vertically transferred metabolites on risk of atopic diseases and infections during preschool age. METHODS: In the Danish population-based COPSAC(2010) mother-child cohort, information on 10 diet-related vertically transferred metabolites from metabolomics profiles of dried blood spots (DBS) at age 2-3 days was analyzed in relation to the risk of childhood asthma, allergy, eczema, and infections using principal component and single metabolite analyses. RESULTS: In 678 children with DBS measurements, a coffee-related metabolite profile reflected by principal component 1 was inversely associated with risk of asthma (odds ratio (95% CI) 0.78 (0.64; 0.95), p = .014) and eczema at age 6 years (0.79 (0.65; 0.97), p = .022). Furthermore, increasing stachydrine (fruit-related), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (fish-related), and ergothioneine (fruit-, green vegetables-, and fish-related) levels were all significantly associated with reduced risks of infections at age 0-3 years (p < .05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates associations between pregnancy diet-related vertically transferred metabolites measured in children in early life and risk of atopic diseases and infections in childhood. The specific metabolites associated with a reduced disease risk in children may contribute to the characterization of a healthy nutritional profile in pregnancy using a metabolomics-based unbiased tool for predicting childhood health.","79":"CASES: Two elderly women each presented with a unilateral, erythematous rash 1 year after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis. Both cases were diagnosed as postsurgical nummular eczema (NE) and treated successfully with topical corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: We highlight a novel clinical presentation of postsurgical NE associated with TKA, previously reported only with breast reconstruction. Postsurgical NE may mimic periprosthetic infection or implant-related allergic contact dermatitis. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment in these cases prevented unnecessary testing and hospital admission for revision surgery. This case series highlights the varied presentation and wide differential diagnosis associated with postsurgical NE.","80":"RATIONALE: Eczematous eruption is an increasingly recognized form of drug-related eruption, typically reported in association with interleukin 17 (IL-17)A inhibitors. However, severe paradoxical eczematous eruption due to IL-17A inhibitors has been rarely reported. Herein, we reported a case of a man with severe psoriasis with erythematous scaly plaques on the scalp, trunk, and arms and legs after the administration of secukinumab was initiated. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of a 20-year-old man with severe psoriasis with erythematous scaly plaques on the scalp, trunk, and arms and legs after the administration of secukinumab was initiated. A skin biopsy was performed. It revealed spongiotic dermatitis consistent with eczematous reaction. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence assays were negative. DIAGNOSES: He was diagnosed with eczematous eruption. INTERVENTIONS: Discontinuation of secukinumab and administration of cyclosporine and prednisone were considered. OUTCOMES: Significant improvement was observed, with no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that eczematous eruption can paradoxically occur in patients on IL-17A inhibitors and this report is expected to increase awareness of the rising number of cutaneous eruptions related to biological agents.","81":null,"82":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The worldwide prevalence of food allergies has been increasing recently. Due to limited data on food allergy (FA) in Saudi Arabia, this study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of parent-reported food allergies and clinical manifestations in children in Taif, Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based observational study was conducted from July 2019 to December 2020. A total of 508 parents of school children (aged five to eight years) responded to the questions based on the child's health and food allergies. RESULTS: FA (16.1%) was observed as the most common type of allergy among children. The prevalence of other atopic diseases was estimated at 30.5%. The most common allergy-causing foods were eggs (4.9%), peanuts (2.7%), and sesame (2.5%). Rash, itching without rash, and vomiting were the most common FA symptoms. The presence of childhood eczema (p< 0.0001), allergic rhinitis (p= 0.005), and the father's history of allergy (p= 0.005) were all significant and independent predictors\/risk factors for FA among the studied children. CONCLUSION: We noted substantial parents' concern with food allergies among children in Saudi Arabia, which necessitates the establishment of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies and primary prevention initiatives.","83":"BACKGROUND: Dermatosis has symptoms of flushing, itching, pain, and burning, which causes psychological distress in patients. METHODS: We collected the data of 214 patients from the Wuhan Institute of Dermatology and Venereology from January 2020 to January 2022, including age, gender, diagnosis, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and anxiety. First, descriptive analysis and difference analysis of the included data were carried out. Second, a correlation matrix was used to exclude the confounding factors with strong collinearity. Finally, logistic regression was used to analyze and predict the risk factors of anxiety. RESULTS: In the anxiety group and nonanxiety group, eczema and generalized eczema accounted for the largest proportion, and there was no difference in the composition of the diagnosis between the 2 groups. Several related analyses proved the accuracy of the logistic model. The results showed that age had a protective effect on the anxiety of patients with skin diseases [odds ratio (OR) =0.8606 with 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7812, 0.8987]. Neurodermatitis (OR =1.0853 with 95% CI: 1.0115, 1.2512), eczema (OR =1.1358 with 95% CI: 1.0215, 1.2129), generalized eczema (OR =1.3346 with 95% CI: 1.1212, 1.5521), and psoriasis (OR =1.3685 with 95% CI: 1.1728, 1.6215) were associated with the anxiety of patients. Prediction analysis showed that with increase of patients' age, the likelihood of anxiety decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a strong correlation between skin diseases and anxiety and that the likelihood of anxiety decreases as age increases. Therefore, psychological intervention for patients with skin diseases, especially young patients, is essential.","84":"The lack of scabies recognition by physicians is often caused by its similarity with other dermatoses and allergies such as eczema, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, etc. The aim of this study was to present the most common misdiagnoses of scabies in physician's work. With the aim of preventing future misdiagnoses in physicians' work, we present 6 cases of patients (1 woman and 5 men, aged 23-82) who had been misdiagnosed prior to admission to our ward (tertiary care unit). In our patients, scabies was unrecognized for months during which time the patients were treated for allergic\/immune diseases (nummular eczema, drug-induced reaction, allergic contact dermatitis, autoimmune skin disease). Additionally, none of our patients had lived in unhygienic conditions or were close to infected persons, but all had concomitant itch. Because of the similarity between scabies and pruritic allergic disorders, it is important to exclude scabies before diagnosing an allergy, based on patient history and skin examination. Early scabies recognition in practice is crucial for minimizing the disease societal impacts.","85":"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is common across all ages. Understanding heterogeneous age-related phenotypes may improve AD management. OBJECTIVE: To determine age-related clinical phenotypes of AD. METHODS: A prospective, dermatology practice-based study was performed (n = 380). AD severity was evaluated using questionnaires and full-body examination. Phenotypes were determined using latent class analysis. RESULTS: There were 23 (6.1%) pediatric patients (<18 years), 176 (46.3%) young adults (18-39 years), and 181 (47.6%) older adults (>\/= 40 years). Both young and older adults experienced less AD on ankles (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.41 [0.19-0.90], 0.43 [0.20-0.94]), moderate-severe AD on flexures (0.47 [0.26-0.87], 0.30 [0.16-0.56]), pityriasis alba (0.24 [0.11-0.52], 0.07 [0.03-0.18]), oozing lesions (0.44 [0.25-0.79], 0.35 [0.20-0.63]), moderate-severe excoriations (0.49 [0.28-0.85], 0.44 [0.26-0.76]), and severe itch (adjusted beta [95% confidence interval], -1.46 [-2.63 to -0.29]; -1.79 [-2.94 to -0.65]) compared with pediatric patients. Young adults experienced more AD around the eyes (2.92 [1.21-7.02]). Older adults experienced more AD on elbows (0.34 [0.19-0.64]), nipples (0.40 [0.16-0.99]), knees (0.27 [0.14-0.53]), keratosis pilaris (0.38 [0.15-0.98]), and lichenification (0.47 [0.22-0.98]). Four classes were identified for distribution of AD and associated signs. CONCLUSION: Distinct phenotypes exist by age with younger patients experiencing more AD signs and symptoms. Clinicians should consider them when managing AD.","86":"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites of gut microbes that can modulate the host inflammatory response, and contribute to health and homeostasis. Since the introduction of the gut-skin axis concept, the link between SCFAs and inflammatory skin diseases has attracted considerable attention. In this review, we have summarized the literature on the role of SCFAs in skin inflammation, and the correlation between SCFAs and inflammatory skin diseases, especially atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and psoriasis. Studies show that SCFAs are signaling factors in the gut-skin axis and can alleviate skin inflammation. The information presented in this review provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving gut-skin axis regulation, along with possible pathways that can be targeted for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory skin diseases.","87":null,"88":"INTRODUCTION: Using data from three clinical trials, the effect of crisaborole treatment on sleep outcomes for pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and their families was examined. METHODS: This analysis comprised patients aged 2 to < 16 years from the double-blind phase 3 CrisADe CORE 1 (NCT02118766) and CORE 2 (NCT02118792) studies, families of patients aged 2 to < 18 years from CORE 1 and CORE 2, and patients aged 3 months to < 2 years from the open-label phase 4 CrisADe CARE 1 study (NCT03356977), all with mild-to-moderate AD who received crisaborole ointment 2% twice daily for 28 days. Sleep outcomes were assessed via the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index and Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaires in CORE 1 and CORE 2 and the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure questionnaire in CARE 1. RESULTS: In CORE 1 and CORE 2, a significantly lower proportion of crisaborole-treated patients than vehicle-treated patients reported sleep disruption at day 29 (48.5% versus 57.7%, p = 0.001). The proportion of families whose sleep was affected by their child's AD in the preceding week was also significantly lower in the crisaborole group (35.8% versus 43.1%, p = 0.02) at day 29. At day 29 in CARE 1, the proportion of crisaborole-treated patients who experienced >\/= 1 night of disturbed sleep in the previous week decreased by 32.1% from baseline. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that crisaborole improves sleep outcomes in pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate AD and their families.","89":"BACKGROUND: Adults aged >\/= 60 years are often underrepresented in atopic dermatitis (AD) clinical trials; age-related comorbidities may impact treatment efficacy and safety. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to report dupilumab efficacy and safety in patients aged >\/= 60 years with moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: Data were pooled from four randomized, placebo-controlled dupilumab trials of patients with moderate-to-severe AD (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and 2, LIBERTY AD CAFE, and LIBERTY AD CHRONOS) and stratified by age (< 60 [N = 2261] and >\/= 60 [N = 183] years). Patients received dupilumab 300 mg every week (qw) or every 2 weeks (q2w), or placebo with\/without topical corticosteroids. Post hoc efficacy at week 16 was examined using broad categorical and continuous assessments of skin lesions, symptoms, biomarkers, and quality of life. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: In the >\/= 60-year-old group at week 16, a greater proportion of dupilumab-treated patients achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0\/1 (q2w: 44.4%; qw: 39.7%) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (63.0%; 61.6%) versus placebo (7.1% and 14.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Type 2 inflammation biomarkers (immunoglobulin E and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) were also significantly reduced in dupilumab- versus placebo-treated patients (P < 0.01). Results were similar in the < 60-year-old group. The exposure-adjusted incidences of adverse events in dupilumab-treated patients were generally similar to those receiving placebo, with numerically fewer treatment-emergent adverse events in the dupilumab-treated >\/= 60-year-old group versus placebo. LIMITATIONS: There were fewer patients in the >\/= 60-year-old group; post hoc analyses. CONCLUSION: Dupilumab improved AD signs and symptoms in patients aged >\/= 60 years; results were comparable to those in patients aged < 60 years. Safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02277743, NCT02277769, NCT02755649, NCT02260986. Does dupilumab benefit adults aged 60 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis?(MP4 20,787 KB).","90":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can significantly decrease quality of life. AD is commonly associated with comorbidities including ocular surface disease (OSD). Conjunctivitis is the most common OSD associated with AD and can increase in incidence with use of monoclonal antibody biologics that target the Type 2 inflammatory pathway. The objective of this review is to raise awareness of comorbid OSD in AD patients that dermatologists may encounter, with a focus on conjunctivitis, and equip dermatologists to address mild ocular concerns. We provide background on the subtypes and pathogenesis of comorbid OSD in AD patients, and describe OSD associated with Type 2 inflammation-inhibiting AD biologics. We also discuss screening and diagnosis, recommended treatment options for dermatologists, and when to refer to an eye care specialist. This multispecialty approach aims to support the overall health of AD patients and provide optimal patient care.","91":"INTRODUCTION: Lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) is often colonised by Staphylococcus aureus and the bacterial abundance increases during a flare. However, the role of S. aureus and the skin microbiome in the pathogenesis of AD, including its influence on the dysfunctional skin barrier and immune response, remains to be elucidated. In this study, the temporal relationship between alterations in the skin barrier function, inflammation and microbiome is examined in adults with AD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This clinical study consists of 81 adult patients with AD, as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria, and 41 age and sex-matched controls. The objectives are to examine alterations in the skin microbiome, skin barrier and immune response during (1) an untreated AD flare, (2) an AD flare treated with topical corticosteroids (TCS), (3) an AD flare treated with systemic dicloxacillin\/placebo and TCS or (4) cutaneous exposure to either autologous S. aureus, staphylococcal enterotoxin B or a vehicle. Skin biopsies, tape strips, skin and nasal swabs are collected and analysed using RNA sequencing, multiplex immunoassays, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and 16S rDNA. Blood samples are analysed for filaggrin gene mutations and leucocyte gene expression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scientific Ethical Committee of the Capital Region in Denmark (phases I and II: H-20011047, phases III and IV: H-21079287), the local data protection agency (phases I and II: P-2020-165, phases III and IV: P-2022-250) and the Danish Medicines Agency (phases III and IV: EudraCT 2021-006883-25, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05578482) have approved the studies. Participants will give written informed consent prior to study initiation. The study is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Outcomes will be presented at national and international conferences and in international peer-reviewed publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05578482, EudraCT 2021-006883-2.","92":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in the general population. Skin barrier dysfunction is the central abnormality leading to AD. The cause of skin barrier dysfunction is complex and rooted in genetic mutations, interactions between the immune pathway activation and epithelial cells, altered host defense mechanisms, as well as environmental influences that cause epithelial cell activation and release of alarmins (such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin) which can activate the type 2 immune pathway, including generation of IL-4 and IL-13, which induces defects in the skin barrier and increased allergic inflammation. These inflammatory pathways are further influenced by environmental factors including the microbiome (especially Staphylococcus aureus), air pollution, stress, and other factors. As such, AD is a syndrome involving multiple phenotypes, all of which have in common skin barrier dysfunction as a key contributing factor. Understanding mechanisms leading to skin barrier dysfunction in AD is pointing to the development of new topical and systemic treatments in AD that helps keep skin borders secure and effectively treat the disease.","93":"Biologic therapies for psoriasis can cause paradoxical eczema. The role of genetic factors in its pathogenesis are unknown. To identify risk variants, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 3212 psoriasis patients, of whom 88 developed paradoxical eczema. Two lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached genome-wide significance (P = <5 x 10(-8)) for association with paradoxical eczema: rs192705221 (near UNC5B, P = 9.52 x 10(-10)) and rs72925168 (within SLC1A2, P = 1.66 x 10(-9)). Genome-wide significant SNPs from published GWAS were used to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for atopic eczema, (PRS(AE)), general atopic disease (PRS(AT)) or a combination (PRS(CO)) which were tested for association with paradoxical eczema. Improvement over a clinical risk model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC). All three atopy PRS were associated with paradoxical eczema (P <0.05); PRS(CO) had the strongest association (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.17-2.84, P = 0.0078). Including atopic PRS in the multivariable model including age, sex, atopic background and psoriatic arthritis history, increased the AUC from 0.671 to 0.681-0.686. Atopic genetic burden is associated with paradoxical eczema occurring in biologic-treated psoriasis patients, indicating shared underlying mechanisms. Incorporating genetic risk may improve treatment outcome prediction models for psoriasis.","94":"PURPOSE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease affecting 10% of children in Europe. The treatment of AD is well codified; however, a gap sometimes exists between recommendations and medical practice. The objective of this study was to assess the practice of French pediatricians regarding the management of AD. METHODS: We conducted a national practice survey from September 2021 to October 2021, using an online questionnaire emailed to pediatric physicians. RESULTS: A total of 83 pediatricians from 33 different departments responded to the survey. The clinical features of AD were known by the majority of pediatricians, but 15 (18%) found the diagnosis difficult to establish. All pediatricians prescribed daily applications of emollients and 78 (94%) prescribed topical corticosteroids (TCS) during AD flares, but misuses remained: only 29 (35%) pediatricians prescribed TCS when eczema (even if minimal) appeared and 43 (52%) did so at the onset of pruritus, while 45 (54%) prescribed them for extensive or disabling eczema, and 53 (64%) when eczema persisted after an initial treatment with emollients. Regarding diet, 12 (14%) pediatricians recommended a diet low on or free of cow milk, 10 (12%) systematically referred children with AD to an allergist, and 20 (24%) delayed food diversification. CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in AD management by French pediatricians in the past 15 years, barriers to its appropriate management still persist, including the misuse of TCS and inappropriate diets.","95":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the scope, quality dimensions and treatment aspects covered by existing quality indicators (QIs) for the somatic diseases bronchial asthma, atopic eczema, otitis media and tonsillitis as well as the psychiatric disorders attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and conduct disorder in paediatrics. METHODS: QIs were identified through an analysis of the guidelines and a systematic search of literature and indicator databases. Subsequently, two researchers independently assigned the QIs to the quality dimensions according to Donabedian and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and to the content categories covering the treatment process. RESULTS: We found 1268 QIs for bronchial asthma, 335 QIs for depression, 199 QIs for ADHD, 115 QIs for otitis media, 72 QIs for conduct disorder, 52 QIs for tonsillitis and 50 QIs for atopic eczema. Of these, 78% focused on process quality, 20% on outcome quality and 2% on structural quality. Using OECD criteria, 72% of the QIs were assigned to effectiveness, 17% to patient-centredness, 11% to patient safety and 1% to efficiency. The QIs covered the following categories: diagnostics (30%), therapy (38%), patient-reported outcome measures\/ observer-reported outcome measures\/patient-reported experience measures (in sum 11%), health monitoring (11%) and office management (11%). CONCLUSION: Most QIs focused on the dimensions of effectiveness and process quality, and on the categories of diagnostics and therapy, with outcome-focused and patient-focused QIs being under-represented. Possible reasons for this striking imbalance could be the easier measurability and clearer assignment of accountability in comparison to the QIs of outcome quality, patient-centredness and patient safety. To produce a more balanced picture of the quality of healthcare, the future development of QIs should prioritise the currently under-represented dimensions.","96":"INTRODUCTION: Progestogen Hypersensitivity (PH) is caused by increased sensitivity to either exogenous or endogenous progestogens. It is characterized by recurrent cutaneous eruptions including erythema multiforme, eczema, urticaria, and angioedema, which may be associated with systemic symptoms including asthma and anaphylaxis. AREAS COVERED: Symptoms may be persistent or cyclical, coinciding with progestogen levels. With increased use of oral contraceptives and hormonal treatments for fertility, the prevalence of PH is expected to continuously increase. Several proposed immunological mechanisms, diagnostics, and treatment modalities have been proposed. Most treatments focus on suppressing ovulation and progesterone secretion or inducing tolerance through progesterone desensitization. EXPERT OPINION: Although there has been increased recognition both clinically and in the medical literature, there is still a general lack of knowledge of PH and its clinical features in the medical community. An improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology as well as more available commercial testis, such as ELISA that accurately measures specific IgE to progesterone, are expected to broaden and improve opportunities for disease recognition and symptom control. It is essential for physicians across specialties to recognize how to diagnose PH and either manage this condition or refer these patients to a specialist with experience treating PH.","97":"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin disease that affects patients' quality of life, especially in the pediatric population. Dupilumab has shown good efficacy and safety in the treatment of AD in adolescents and adults, but the real data on younger children using dupilumab are scarce. Objectives: We investigated the doses, efficacy, and safety of dupilumab in children with moderate-to-severe AD aged >\/=6 months to 11 years. Methods: This single-center retrospective cohort analysis included dupilumab-treated patients with severe AD under 12 years of age. Primary endpoints included the proportion of Validated Investigator Global Assessment (vIGA) 0\/1 achieved and the percentage change from baseline in eczema area and severity index (EASI) and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at week 24 (W24). Secondary endpoints were mean change in pruritus numerical rating score (P-NRS) and body surface area (BSA) after W24 of treatment, description of adverse events, and Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) improvement from baseline in endpoints. Results: Fifty-seven patients were included (mean age 7.2 +\/- 3.0 years). The primary endpoint (vIGA = 0\/1) was achieved by 51 of 57 (89.5%) patients at W24. Significant improvements in EASI, SCORAD, P-NRS, and CDLQI scores were observed from baseline to W24 with dupilumab treatment and remained until W40. In different age groups, the endpoint vIGA achieved 0\/1: 95.2% (20\/21) of younger children and 88.9% (32\/36) of older children. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Conclusions: This study aimed to describe the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in pediatric patients and examined differences of efficacy with various doses. The outcomes are comparable with those of existing clinical trials. Phase III Clinical Trial: NCT03346434.","98":"Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians. The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis.","99":"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is ranked as the third most prevalent skin condition with a worldwide prevalence of 2.4%. Atopic dermatitis is a common form of eczema. It develops in infancy or childhood and continues into adulthood with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Pruritis and inflammation are the hallmark symptoms of AD. MECHANISM OF ACTION, PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND PHARMACOKINETICS: Abrocitinib is a JAK1 selective inhibitor; inhibition results in a decreased interleukin (IL) 4 activation and decreased pruritis in a patient with AD. Abrocitinib is hepatically metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, and dose modification may be required when administered with concurrent medications. CLINICAL TRIALS: At least 6 JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) trials were conducted evaluating Investigator's Global Assessment and Eczema Area and Severity Index score for efficacy. All JADE trials showed abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg doses efficacious when compared with placebo. Common adverse reactions were related to gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, and acne. Serious adverse reactions to assess risk for include serious infections, malignancy, major adverse cardiovascular events, and venous thromboembolisms. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCE: Abrocitinib provides a valuable treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD unresponsive to other therapies for those candidates without a high risk for significant adverse reaction associated with its use."},"CI":{"0":["This article is protected by copyright.

This was determined using four","measures. First, a smaller proportion of children who were treated with","crisaborole experienced sleep disruption compared with those to whom a vehicle","was applied (an ointment with no drug). Second, a smaller proportion of","caregivers of children with AD who were treated with crisaborole reported effects","on their sleep, compared with children to whom a vehicle was applied. Third, a","smaller proportion of children with AD who were treated with crisaborole, as well","as their caregivers, had >\/= 1 night per week of disturbed sleep after treatment","compared with before treatment. Fourth, the caregivers of children treated with","crisaborole reported significantly less exhaustion and tiredness because of the","child's AD.
