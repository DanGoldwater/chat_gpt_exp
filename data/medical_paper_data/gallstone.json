factors, such as initial body weight before surgery, sex, and dietary intake. Moreover, rapid weight loss is associated with an increased incidence of postsurgical cholelithiasis. To investigate the observed weight loss outcomes during the first year after BS, we investigated the factors that may influence weight loss and to detect the efficacy of prophylactic ursodeoxycholic acid against gallstone formation. This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients with morbid obesity who underwent BS in the hospital and completed a 1-year follow up. Patients with a previous BS or a history of cholecystectomy before BS were excluded. Data were extracted from the medical records at multiple postoperative intervals. There was significant weight loss in terms of percentage of excess weight loss and reduction in body mass index postoperative. A significant correlation was found between the percent of excess weight loss and age, initial body mass index, and initial weight, but there was no significant correlation with sex or type of surgery. The incidence of postoperative cholecystectomy is almost negligible. A significant association was found between age and weight loss after BS. ursodeoxycholic acid is an effective prophylaxis to decrease the incidence of cholecystectomy after BS.","1":"A 54-year-old man presented with signs of small bowel obstruction. CT showed the Riglers triad: pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction and an ectopic calcified gallstone. The ileus is caused by a gallstone which has perforated through a choleduodenal fistula.","2":"Obesity by itself is a factor in the development of gallstone disease, and periods of weight loss after bariatric surgery further increase the risk of gallstone formation. In patients with obesity, hypersecretion of cholesterol may increase the risk of gallstone formation, which is approximately five-fold higher than that in the general population. The incidence of gallstone formation after bariatric surgery is 10-38% and often associated with a proportional increase in the risk of developing biliary complications. Routine postoperative administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is recommended to prevent gallstone formation. Several randomized trials have indicated that UDCA can effectively prevent gallstones and reduce the risk of cholecystectomy after bariatric procedures. The effective daily dose of UDCA in each study ranged from 500 to 1,200 mg, and it may be considered at least during the period of rapid weight loss (first 3-6 months postoperatively) to decrease the incidence of symptomatic gallstones.","3":"Bowel obstruction\/ileus is a relatively common occurrence in surgical practice with a predictable clinical presentation and management course. Rarely are these cases found consistent with gallstone etiology. Known as gallstone ileus (GI), this uncommon presentation is found primarily in elderly females (age > 65 years old) with multiple comorbid conditions; usually with coinciding presence of a cholecystoenteric fistula. Surgical management remains controversial due to the rarity of presentation and complexity of related pathological process. We present a case of a 69-year-old female who presented with typical signs\/symptoms of bowel obstruction but found to have sigmoid GI on computed tomography imaging evaluation. A single stage exploratory laparotomy with simple enterolithotomy was performed with a positive outcome and uncomplicated postoperative recovery. The primary goal in reporting this case is to continue emphasizing the efficacy of a single stage simple enterolithotomy as the most ideal surgical management of this rare condition.","4":"BACKGROUND: Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is inflammation of the gallbladder without evidence of calculi. Although rarely reported, its etiologies include hepatitis virus infection (e.g., hepatitis A virus, HAV) and adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). There are no reports of HAV-associated AAC in an AOSD patient. CASE SUMMARY: Here we report a rare case of HAV infection-associated AAC in a 39-year-old woman who had a history of AOSD. The patient presented with an acute abdomen and hypotension. Elevated hepatobiliary enzymes and a thickened and distended gallbladder without gallstones on ultrasonography suggested AAC, but there were no signs of anemia nor thrombocytopenia. Serological screening revealed anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Steroid treatment did not alleviate her symptoms, and she was referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The resected gallbladder was hydropic without perforation, and her clinical signs gradually improved after surgery. CONCLUSION: AAC can be caused by HAV in AOSD patients. It is crucial to search for the underlying etiology for AAC, especially uncommon viral causes.","5":"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a biliary tract tumor with a high mortality rate. The objectives of this study were to explore the risk factors of GBC in patients with gallstones and to establish effective screening indicators. METHODS: A total of 588 patients from medical centers in two different regions of China were included in this study and defined as the internal test samples and the external validation samples, respectively. We retrospectively reviewed the differences in clinicopathologic data of the internal test samples to find the independent risk factors that affect the occurrence of GBC. Then, we constructed three different combined predictive factors (CPFs) through the weighting method, integral system, and nomogram, respectively, and named them CPF-A, CPF-B, and CPF-C sequentially. Furthermore, we evaluated these indicators through calibration and DCA curves. The ROC curve was used to analyze their diagnostic efficiency. Finally, their diagnostic capabilities were validated in the external validation samples. RESULTS: In the internal test samples, the results showed that five factors, namely, age (RR = 3.077, 95% CI: 1.731-5.496), size of gallstones (RR = 13.732, 95% CI: 5.937-31.762), course of gallstones (RR = 2.438, 95% CI: 1.350-4.403), CEA (RR = 9.464, 95% CI: 3.394-26.392), and CA199 (RR = 9.605, 95% CI: 4.512-20.446), were independent risk factors for GBC in patients with gallstones. Then, we established three predictive indicators: CPF-A, CPF-B, and CPF-C. These models were further validated using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions. Calibration and decision curve analysis showed that the three models fit well. Meanwhile, multivariate analysis showed that CPF-B and CPF-C were independent risk factors for GBC in patients with gallstones. In addition, the validation results of the external validation samples are essentially consistent with the internal test samples. CONCLUSION: Age (<\/=58.5 vs. >58.5 years), size of gallstones (<\/=1.95 vs. >1.95cm), course of gallstones (<\/=10 vs. >10 years), CEA (<\/=5 vs. >5 ng\/ml), and CA199 (<\/=37 vs. >37 U\/ml) are independent risk factors for GBC in patients with gallstones. When positive indicators were >\/=2 among the five independent risk factors or the score of the nomogram was >82.64, the risk of GBC was high in gallstone patients.","6":"In recent times Gallbladder cancer (GBC) incidences increased many folds in India and are being reported from arsenic hotspots identified in Bihar. The study aims to establish association between arsenic exposure and gallbladder carcinogenesis. In the present study, n = 200 were control volunteers and n = 152 confirmed gallbladder cancer cases. The studied GBC patient's biological samples-gallbladder tissue, gallbladder stone, bile, blood and hair samples were collected for arsenic estimation. Moreover, n = 512 gallbladder cancer patients blood samples were also evaluated for the presence of arsenic to understand exposure level in the population. A significantly high arsenic concentration (p < 0.05) was detected in the blood samples with maximum concentration 389 microg\/L in GBC cases in comparison to control. Similarly, in the gallbladder cancer patients, there was significantly high arsenic concentration observed in gallbladder tissue with highest concentration of 2166 microg\/kg, in gallbladder stones 635 microg\/kg, in bile samples 483 microg\/L and in hair samples 6980 microg\/kg respectively. Moreover, the n = 512 gallbladder cancer patient's blood samples study revealed very significant arsenic concentration in the population of Bihar with maximum arsenic concentration as 746 microg\/L. The raised arsenic concentration in the gallbladder cancer patients' biological samples-gallbladder tissue, gallbladder stone, bile, blood, and hair samples was significantly very high in the arsenic exposed area. The study denotes that the gallbladder disease burden is very high in the arsenic exposed area of Bihar. The findings do provide a strong link between arsenic contamination and increased gallbladder carcinogenesis.","7":"Mirizzi syndrome (MS) describes a rare complication of cholelithiasis resulting from extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct by impacted gallstones in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch. MS is most commonly seen in adults and is more prevalent in the female population. Due to the pathophysiology of MS being similar to other causes of cholecystitis and biliary obstruction, the symptomatology is rather nonspecific. While ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are commonly used for diagnosis, treatment of this condition typically involves cholecystectomy. Identifying MS versus other more common causes of obstructive jaundice is paramount in limiting complications. In this report, we describe a case of MS diagnosed in a 32-year-old male who presented with nonspecific abdominal pain and other signs of obstructive jaundice. The goal of this study is to show how identifying a rare underlying cause of a common presentation can lead to improved patient outcomes.","8":"Cholecystectomy is the definite treatment for symptomatic gallstones, and rates are rapidly rising. Symptomatic complicated gallstones are generally treated with cholecystectomy, but there is no consensus on the clinical selection of patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones for cholecystectomy. The aim of this review is to describe symptomatic outcomes before versus after cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic gallstones as reported in prospective clinical studies and to discuss patient selection for cholecystectomy. Following cholecystectomy, resolution of biliary pain is high and reported for 66-100%. Dyspepsia has an intermediate resolution of 41-91% and may co-exist with biliary pain but may also develop following cholecystectomy with an increase of 150%. Diarrhea has a high increase and debuts in 14-17%. Persisting symptoms are mainly determined by preoperative dyspepsia, functional disorders, atypical pain locations, longer duration of symptoms, and poor psychological or physical health. Patient satisfaction following cholecystectomy is high and may reflect symptom alleviation or a change in symptoms. Comparison of symptomatic outcomes in available prospective clinical studies is limited by variations in preoperative symptoms, clinical presentations, and clinical management of post-cholecystectomy symptoms. When selecting patients with biliary pain only in a randomized controlled trial, 30-40% still have persisting pain. Strategies for the selection of patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones based on symptoms alone are exhausted. For the development of a selection strategy, future studies should explore the impact of objective determinants for symptomatic gallstones on pain relief following cholecystectomy.","9":"The management policy of concomitant cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis is based on a one- or two-stage procedure. It basically includes either laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration (LCBDE) in the same operation or LC with preoperative, postoperative and even intraoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-endoscopic sphincterotomy (ERCP-ES) for stone clearance. The most frequently used worldwide option is preoperative ERCP-ES and stone removal followed by LC, preferably on the next day. In cases where preoperative ERCP-ES is not feasible, the proposed alternative of intraoperative rendezvous ERCP-ES simultaneously with LC has been advocated. The intraoperative extraction of CBD stones is superior to postoperative rendezvous ERCP-ES. However, there is no consensus on the superiority of laparoendoscopic rendezvous. This is equivalent to a traditional two-stage procedure. Endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation reduces recurrence. LCBDE and intraoperative ERCP have similar good outcomes. The risk of recurrence after ERCP-ES is greater than that after LCBDE. Laparoscopic ultrasonography may delineate the anatomy and detect CBD stones. The majority of surgeons prefer the transcductal instead of the transcystic approach for CBDE with or without T-tube drainage, but the transcystic approach must be used where possible. LCBDE is a safe and effective choice when performed by an experienced surgeon. However, the requirement of specific equipment and advanced training are drawbacks. The percutaneous approach is an alternative when ERCP fails. Surgical or endoscopic reintervention for retained stones may be needed. For asymptomatic CBD stones, ERCP clearance is the first-choice method. Both one-stage and two-stage management are acceptable and can ensure improved quality of life.","10":"The management of gallbladder diseases, including acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis, puts a significant strain on healthcare. The first-line treatment for acute cholecystitis is cholecystectomy. Patients who have concomitant choledocholithiasis, large stones, and\/or gallstone pancreatitis may also benefit from endoscopic interventions. Endoscopic treatments may also be utilized in patients who are not surgical candidates due to underlying comorbidities. Studies examining the role of endoscopic lithotripsy in concomitant cholecystitis are limited. Herein we present a case series in which an AXIOS stent (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) was placed into the gallbladder for decompression and utilized to access the gallbladder lumen to perform electrohydraulic lithotripsy in two patients.","11":"Bouveret syndrome is a rare and dangerous complication of cholelithiasis in which a gallstone lodges in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. We report the case of an 85-year-old female that presented without many of the clinical symptoms and complaints characteristic of gallstone ileus, further complicated by significant cardiac pathology. We review the existing studies of this uncommon disease and discuss its clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapeutic options.","12":"With the increasing number of surgical interventions for obesity, the numbers of associated complications, such as gallstones after bariatric surgery are also increasing. The incidence of postbariatric symptomatic cholecystolithiasis is 5-10%; however, the numbers of severe complications due to gallstones and the probability of a necessary extraction of gallstones are low. For this reason, a simultaneous or preoperative cholecystectomy should only be carried out in symptomatic patients. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid reduced the risk of gallstone formation in randomized trials but not the risk of complications related to gallstones in cases of pre-existing gallstones. The most frequently used access route to bile ducts after intestinal bypass procedures is the laparoscopic approach via the stomach remnants. Other possible access routes are the enteroscopic approach as well as the endosonography-guided puncture of the stomach remnants.","13":"Lithotripsy has been used for decades in the treatment of kidney stones and gallstones, in which ultrasound shock waves generated outside of the body are used to physically break up hardened masses. In the past decade, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a technology developed by Shockwave Medical Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), has emerged as a novel therapy for the treatment of vascular calcification. In the coronary blood vessels, IVL modifies arterial calcium and enables percutaneous coronary interventions to be performed in a safe and consistent manner, and in the peripheral blood vessels, IVL can be used as a standalone therapy in the treatment of calcified plaque in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Due to the success of the Disrupt CAD and Disrupt PAD clinical trials, IVL is now FDA-approved in the United States for use in both patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and PAD. The widespread adoption of IVL for PAD is likely to mirror the swift uptake seen in CAD. Although questions remain regarding IVL's high cost and performance compared directly to other technologies such as atherectomy, its ease of use, speed, and safety makes its future extremely promising for the treatment of complex, heavily calcified lesions in both peripheral and coronary vessels. Despite this, more studies are certainly needed to determine in what clinical scenarios IVL should be considered as opposed to atherectomy and if there are types of calcified lesions where IVL is best utilized (ie, concentric vs eccentric).","14":"Congenital duplication of the extrahepatic bile duct (DEBD) is an unusual anomaly of the biliary system. It occurs due to inability of the embryological duplex biliary system to regress. DEBD has various subtypes depending on the morphology and opening of the aberrant common bile duct. It can have distinct complications. We encountered a 38-year-old lady who experienced pain in the right upper abdomen along with a low-grade fever. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed DEBD with multiple calculi in the right hepatic duct (ductolithiasis) and joining of the right hepatic duct with the left hepatic duct in the intrapancreatic region. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography failed to clear the calculi from the right duct. They were then managed by common bile duct exploration and roux-en-Y right hepaticojejunostomy for biliary drainage. Her postoperative period was uneventful. She is currently doing well after three months of follow-up. Hence, a proper preoperative delineation of such rare anomalies is essential. It could avoid inadvertent injury to the bile duct and operative complications.","15":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been a widely used procedure in the diagnosis and treatment of various pancreaticobiliary disorders. Although widely considered a safe procedure, ERCP is associated morbidity and occasional mortality. The most common complications include acute pancreatitis, hemorrhage, and duodenal perforation. Portal vein cannulation is a rare complication of ERCP. We described a case of placement of an endoscopic biliary stent in the portal vein during ERCP and sphinc-terotomy. A 54-year-old female patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a pre-diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis with gallstones. She visited emergency unit with the complaint of jaundice and itching on the 4th post-operative day. On the magnetic res-onance cholangiopancreatography, the intrahepatic and the extrahepatic bile ducts were dilated and a 7.5x5.5 mm stone at common bile duct. Sphincterotomy was performed by ERCP, the stones were removed, and then a 10F 7 cm stent was installed. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) was performed on the 4th day of ERCP in the patient whose fever and total bilirubin levels persisted at 5 mg\/dL, considering cholangitic abscess and\/or ERCP complication. On the CT, the proximal end of the stent in the common bile duct was observed to enter into the main portal vein and the tip was observed to be thrombosed. Therefore, it was decided to remove the stent endoscopically under operating room conditions. After the anesthesia induction, the stent was endoscopically removed by the gastroenterology team. The abdominal cavity of patient was explored laparoscopically in the during of stent removal. The patient did not experience hemodynamic instability and did not require transfusion during anesthesia but had melena once on the clinical follow-up. The patient was discharged with low molecular weight heparin and oral cephalosporin and was advised to return for polyclinic control. Doppler ultrasonography (USG) was performed to evaluate the thrombosis of the portal vein in the patient who had intermittent fever during the controls. Doppler USG revealed a thrombosed appearance in the main portal vein and its branches. The patient, who was in good general condition and had no abdominal pain, was switched to high-dose low molecular weight heparin and followed under the control of the gastroenterology and general surgery outpatient clinic. This rare life-threatening complication should always be kept in mind especially during the procedure and\/or in the clinical follow-up of the patient.","16":"AIM: Hepatobiliary and pancreatic (HBP) cancers are among the deadliest malignancies. The objective of the study is to build cost-effective models to identify high-risk individuals for early diagnosis and substantially to reduce the burden of HBP cancers. METHODS: Based on the prospective Dongfeng-Tongji cohort with  approximately 6 years follow-up, we identified 162 incident cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 53 of biliary tract cancer (BTC), and 58 of pancreatic cancer (PC). We matched three controls to each case by age, sex, and hospital. We applied conditional logistic regression to identify predictive clinical variables, from which we constructed clinical risk scores (CRSs). We evaluated the utility of CRSs in stratifying high-risk individuals by 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Among 50 variables we screened, 6 were independent predictors of HCC, with the top ones being hepatitis (OR = 8.51, 95% CI (3.83, 18.9)), plateletcrit (OR = 0.57, 95% CI (0.42, 0.78)), and alanine aminotransferase (OR = 2.06, 95% CI (1.39, 3.06)). Gallstone (OR = 2.70, 95% CI (1.17, 6.24)) and direct bilirubin (OR = 1.58, 95% CI (1.08, 2.31)) were predictive of BTC, while hyperlipidemia (OR = 2.56, 95% CI (1.12, 5.82)) and fasting blood glucose (OR = 2.00, 95% CI (1.26, 3.15)) were predictive of PC. The CRSs achieved AUCs of 0.784 for HCC, 0.648 for BTC, and 0.666 for PC, respectively. When applying to the full cohort with age and sex included as predictors, the AUCs were increased to 0.818, 0.704, and 0.699, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Disease history and routine clinical variables are predictive of incident HBP cancers in elderly Chinese.","17":null,"18":"BACKGROUND: Treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) poses a particular challenge given the altered anatomy and inability to perform a standard endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram (ERC). The optimal treatment strategy for intraoperatively encountered CBD stones in post-RYGB patients has not been established. OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes following laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct exploration (LTCBDE) and laparoscopy-assisted transgastric ERC for CBDs during cholecystectomy in RYGB-operated patients. SETTING: Swedish nationwide multi-registry study. METHODS: The Swedish Registry for Gallstone Surgery and ERCs, GallRiks (n = 215,670), and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg) (n = 60,479) were cross-matched for cholecystectomies with intraoperatively encountered CBD stones in patients with previous RYGB surgery between 2011 and 2020. RESULTS: Registry cross-matching found 550 patients. Both LTCBDE (n = 132) and transgastric ERC (n = 145) were comparable in terms of low rates of intraoperative adverse events (1% versus 2%) and postoperative adverse events within 30 days (16% versus 18%). LTCBDE required significantly shorter operating time (P = .005) by on average 31 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) [10.3-52.6], and was more often used for smaller stones <4 mm in size (30% versus 17%, P = .010). However, transgastric ERC was more often used in acute surgery (78% versus 63%, P = .006) and for larger stones >8 mm in size (25% versus 8%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: LTCBDE and transgastric ERC have similarly low complication rates for clearance of intraoperatively encountered CBD stones in RYGB-operated patients, but LTCBDE is faster while transgastric ERC is more often used in conjunction with larger bile duct stones.","19":"IMPORTANCE: Approximately 335,000 cases of biliary colic present to US emergency departments (EDs) annually, and most patients without complications are discharged from the ED. It is unknown what are the subsequent surgery rates, subsequent complications of biliary disease, ED revisits, repeat hospitalizations and cost; and, how does the ED disposition decision (admission versus discharge) affect long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a difference in one-year surgery rates, complications of biliary disease, ED revisits, repeat hospitalizations, and cost in ED patients with uncomplicated biliary colic who are admitted to the hospital versus those that are discharged from the ED. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using records collected from the Maryland Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) in the Ambulatory Surgery, the Inpatient, and the ED setting between 2016 and 2018. After applying inclusion criteria, 7036 ED patients with uncomplicated biliary colic were followed for one year after their index ED visit for repeat healthcare utilization across multiple settings. A multivariable logistic regression study was performed to asses for risk factors for surgery allocation and hospital admission. Medicare Relative Value Units (RVUs) and HCUP Cost-Charge Ratio files were used to estimate direct costs. EXPOSURES: Episodes of biliary colic were ascertained using ICD-10 codes at the index ED visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the one-year surgery rate, defined as a cholecystectomy. Secondary outcomes included the rate of new acute cholecystitis or other related complications, ED revisits, hospital admission and costs. Associations with hospital admission and surgeries were measured using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % CIs. RESULTS: Of the 7036 patients analyzed, 793 (11.3 %) were admitted and 6243 (88.7 %) were discharged on their initial ED visit. When comparing the groups who were initially admitted versus discharged, we observed similar one-year cholecystectomy rates (42 % versus 43 %, mean difference 0.5 %, 95 % CI -3.1 %-4.2 %; P < 0.001), lower rates of new cholecystitis occurrences (18 % versus 41 %, mean difference 23 %, 95 % CI, 20 %-26 %; P < 0.001), lower rates of ED revisits (96 vs 198 per 1000 patients, mean difference 102, 95 % CI, 74-130; P < 0.001) and higher costs ($9880 versus $1832, mean difference 8048, 95 % CI, 7478-8618; P < 0.001). Initial ED hospital admission was associated with increased age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.35-1.53; P < 0.001), obesity (aOR, 1.38; 95 % CI, 1.32-1.44; P < 0.001), ischemic heart disease (aOR, 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.30-1.48; P < 0.001), mood disorders (aOR, 1.18; 95 % CI, 1.13-1.24; P < 0.001), alcohol-related disorders (aOR, 1.20; 95 % CI, 1.12-1.27; P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (aOR, 1.16; 95 % CI, 1.09-1.23; P < 0.001), hypertension (aOR, 1.15; 95 % CI, 1.08-1.21; P < 0.001), and nicotine dependence (aOR, 1.09; 95 % CI, 1.03-1.15; P = 0.003) but not associated with race (P > 0.9), ethnicity (P > 0.9), or income-stratified zip code (aOR, 1.04; 95 % CI, 0.98-1.09; P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In our analysis of ED patients with uncomplicated biliary colic from a single state, the majority of patients do not receive a cholecystectomy within one year and hospital admission at the initial visit was not associated with an overall change in rates of cholecystectomy but was associated with increased costs. These findings inform our understanding of the long-term outcomes and are important considerations when communicating care options with ED patients with biliary colic.","20":"OBJECTIVE: We present an unusual case report of a pregnant patient with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis due to cholecystolithiasis. CONCLUSION: Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy is a rare disease. Unlike the non-pregnant population, it is characterized by a high recurrence rate. Acute pancreatitis during pregnancy has a negative effect on both the mother and the fetus. The treatment is modified depending on the trimester of pregnancy.","21":"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a lethal cancer with a poor prognosis. The lack of specific and sensitive biomarkers results in delayed diagnosis with most patients presenting at late stages of the disease. Furthermore, there is little known about the molecular mechanisms associated with GBC, especially in patients of African ancestry. This study aimed to determine dysregulated proteins in South African GBC patients to identify potential mechanisms of the disease progression and plausible biomarkers. METHODS: Tissues (27 GBC, 13 Gallstone disease, and 5 normal tissues) and blood plasma (54 GBC and 73 Benign biliary pathology) were obtained from consenting patients. Protein extraction was performed on all tissues and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for proteomic profiling. A project-specific spectral library was built using the Pulsar search algorithm. Principal component and Spearman's rank correlation analyses were performed using PAST (V4.07b). Pathway and Network analyses were conducted using REACTOME (v3.7) and stringAPP (v1.7.0), respectively. RESULTS: In the tissue sample group, there were 62 and 194 dysregulated proteins in GBC compared to normal and gallstone groups, respectively. In the plasma group, there were 33 altered proteins in GBC compared to the benign biliary pathology group. We found 9 proteins (APOA1, APOA2, RET4, TTR, HEMO, HBB, HBA, PIGR, and APOE) to be commonly dysregulated in both tissue and plasma. Furthermore, a subset analysis demonstrated that 2 proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, were downregulated in GBC patients with GD history compared to those without. Pathway analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins in GBC patients were enriched in pathways involved in smooth muscle contraction, metabolism, ECM organization, and integrin cell surface interactions. CONCLUSION: The identified dysregulated proteins help in understanding GBC molecular mechanisms in our patient group. Furthermore, the alteration of specific proteins in both tissue and plasma samples suggests their potential utility as biomarkers of GBC in this sample cohort.","22":"OBJECTIVE: Routine urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy (ES) does not improve outcome in patients with predicted severe acute biliary pancreatitis. Improved patient selection for ERCP by means of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for stone\/sludge detection may challenge these findings. DESIGN: A multicentre, prospective cohort study included patients with predicted severe acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis. Patients underwent urgent EUS, followed by ERCP with ES in case of common bile duct stones\/sludge, within 24 hours after hospital presentation and within 72 hours after symptom onset. The primary endpoint was a composite of major complications or mortality within 6 months after inclusion. The historical control group was the conservative treatment arm (n=113) of the randomised APEC trial (Acute biliary Pancreatitis: urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy versus conservative treatment, patient inclusion 2013-2017) applying the same study design. RESULTS: Overall, 83 patients underwent urgent EUS at a median of 21 hours (IQR 17-23) after hospital presentation and at a median of 29 hours (IQR 23-41) after start of symptoms. Gallstones\/sludge in the bile ducts were detected by EUS in 48\/83 patients (58%), all of whom underwent immediate ERCP with ES. The primary endpoint occurred in 34\/83 patients (41%) in the urgent EUS-guided ERCP group. This was not different from the 44% rate (50\/113 patients) in the historical conservative treatment group (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.29; p=0.65). Sensitivity analysis to correct for baseline differences using a logistic regression model also showed no significant beneficial effect of the intervention on the primary outcome (adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.90, p=0.92). CONCLUSION: In patients with predicted severe acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis, urgent EUS-guided ERCP with ES did not reduce the composite endpoint of major complications or mortality, as compared with conservative treatment in a historical control group.

The one-step method involves laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, and primary close (LC + LCBDE + PC), while the two-step procedure consists of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic sphincterotomy, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ERCP + EST + LC). OBJECTIVE: This multicenter retrospective study aimed to analyze and compare the effects of the two techniques. METHODS: The data of patients who underwent either one-step LCBDE + LC + PC or two-step ERCP + EST + LC treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder and bile duct at the Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, and Taizhou Fourth People's Hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 were collected, and the preoperative indicators of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The surgical success rate of the one-step laparoscopic group was 96.23% (664\/690), the transit abdominal opening rate was 2.03% (14\/690), and there were 21 cases of postoperative bile leakage. The success rate of the two-step endolaparoscopic surgery was 78.95% (225\/285), the transit opening rate was 2.46% (7\/285), and there were 43 postoperative cases of pancreatitis and five of cholangitis. Postoperative cholangitis, pancreatitis, postoperative stone recurrence, postoperative hospitalization, and treatment costs were significantly lower (P< 0.05) in the one-step laparoscopic group than in the two-step endolaparoscopic group. However, the amount of intraoperative bleeding, the postoperative extraction time of the abdominal drainage tube, and the incidence of bile leakage were higher (P< 0.05) in the one-step laparoscopic group than in the two-step endolaparoscopic group. CONCLUSION: The two methods of treating choledocholithiasis combined with choledocholithiasis that were analyzed in this study were safe and effective, and each method had its own advantages.","24":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard surgical treatment of gallstone disease and a commonly performed procedure in general surgery. Retained gallstones from intraoperative spillage remain largely asymptomatic and complications are rare. Peak incidence of presentation occurs within a year; however, it is important to recognize retained gallstones as a differential for acute presentations even many years postoperatively. We present the case of a 74-year-old female who presented with a retained-gallstone-associated abdominal wall abscess 30 years after spillage during the original surgery, which was successfully treated with a stepwise extraperitoneal approach with local drainage.","25":"Gallstone ileus is an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction. It is caused when a gallstone migrates through an enterobiliary fistula (most often between the duodenum and the gallbladder) and is impacted in the digestive system, most often in the terminal ileum toward the ileocaecal valve. CASE PRESENTATION: Here the authors report the case of a 74-year-old woman who was admitted to Compiegne Hospital in France for a gallstone ileus with the sigmoid colon as the impaction site, which is an even more rare cause of intestinal obstruction. The enterobiliary fistula was between the colon and the gallbladder.The gallstone was removed surgically with a colotomy, without treating the fistula, and after a failed endoscopic attempt to extract the stone. The follow-up was without complications, and a colposcopy showed spontaneous closure of the fistula after 6 weeks. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The surgical closure of an enterobiliary fistula is an option that should be considered, but it can lead to higher morbidity. That is why the authors opted out of it, especially considering that spontaneous closure of the fistulae can happen, as it did in our case.","26":"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), the procedure of choice for treating most gallbladder pathology, has become the most trusted elective procedure for treating gallstone disease because of its effectiveness and safety. While the timing is an important factor in those cases, our aim in this study was to compare emergency and elective LC, determine the differences in postoperative complications, and assess the conversion rate to open cholecystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 627 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy during 2017-2019 at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU). Records of both emergency and elective cases were reviewed from Quadra-med (software package). All demographic data of the patients, presenting complaint, laboratory and inflammatory marker, type of the operation, intraoperative complications, procedure time, conversion rate from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy, postoperative period, length of hospital stay, and pathological diagnosis were entered into an Excel sheet. The data was analyzed using SPSS 23.0. Qualitative variables were described as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were summarized with mean and standard deviation (SD). Chi-square test, t-test, and the Mann-Whitney U-test were applied to test for statistical significance at P <\/= 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age for patients undergoing elective LC was 39.94 years (SD=13.56) whereas, mean age of patients undergoing emergency LC was 40.64 years (SD=13.02). About 71% of cases in elective LC group were females compared to 55% in the emergency LC group. There was a significant difference in C-reactive protein (CRP) in relation to the type of surgery where P < 0.05. Twelve (1.9%) patients had subtotal cholecystectomy and two cases converted from LC to open. There was a significant association between postoperative complication and the type of surgery. The length of hospital stay (LOS) was also found to be significantly more in patients having emergency LC (6.0 vs. 4.5 d; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The relation between conversion to an open procedure and type of surgery (elective or emergency) in our study was nonsignificant. There was a significant association between preoperative CRP, postoperative complication, length of hospital stay, and type of surgery. Further multicenter studies are required for further investigation.","27":"Female sex, high estrogen levels, aging, obesity, and dyslipidemia are some of the risk factors associated with gallstone formation. HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are more prone to hypercholesterolemia. Bile acid synthesis is initiated by cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, and LXRb). The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, LXRb, and miRNAs (HNF4alpha specific: miR-194-5p and miR-122(*)_1) that regulate CYP7A1 transcription in HIV-infected Black South African women on cART and presenting with gallstones relative to HIV-negative patients with gallstone disease. Females (n = 96) presenting with gallstone disease were stratified based on HIV status. The gene expression of CYP7A1, HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, LXRb, miR-194-5p, and miR-122(*)_1 was determined using RT-qPCR. Messenger RNA and miRNA levels were reported as fold change expressed as 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) (RQ min; RQ max). Fold changes >2 and <0.5 were considered significant. HIV-infected females were older in age (p = 0.0267) and displayed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (p = 0.0419), CYP7A1 [2.078-fold (RQ min: 1.278; RQ max: 3.381)], LXRb [2.595-fold (RQ min: 2.001; RQ max: 3.000)], and HNF1alpha [3.428 (RQ min: 1.806; RQ max: 6.507] levels. HNF4alpha [0.642-fold (RQ min: 0.266; RQ max: 1.55)], miR-194-5p [0.527-fold (RQ min: 0.37; RQ max: 0.752)], and miR-122*_1 [0.595-fold (RQ min: 0.332; RQ max: 1.066)] levels were lower in HIV-infected females. In conclusion, HIV-infected women with gallstone disease displayed higher LDL-c levels and increased bile acid synthesis, which was evidenced by the elevated expression of CYP7A1, HNF1alpha, and LXRb. This could have been further influenced by cART and aging.","28":"Gallstones are a common surgical pathology. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy represents the elective treatment. Complicated cases can increase the rate of conversion, the duration, and the difficulty of the intervention, along with the hospitalization period. A prospective cohort study was conducted on 51 patients with gallstones. Only subjects with normal renal, pancreatic, and hepatic functions were included. The severity of cholecystitis was evaluated by considering the ultrasound examination, intraoperative findings, and pathology report. We evaluated two potential biomarkers, namely neopterin and chitotriosidase, by comparing their levels before and after the intervention for chronic (n = 36) and complicated (n = 15) cases, as well as their eventual association with the hospitalization period. Subjects with complicated cholecystitis had significantly higher (p = 0.01) neopterin levels at presentation (16.82 nmol\/L vs. 11.92 nmol\/L, median values), but the differences in chitotriosidase activity between complicated (170.00 nmol\/mL\/h) and chronic (160.00 nmol\/mL\/h) cases were not significant (p = 0.66). Patients with neopterin levels above the cut-off value 14.69 nmol\/L had a 3.34 times higher risk of complicated cholecystitis. Twenty-four hours after the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the differences in neopterin level and chitotriosidase activity between chronic and complicated cases were not significant. A significant decrease in chitotriosidase activity was observed after the intervention, only for complicated cases (190 nmol\/mL\/h vs. 145 nmol\/mL\/h, p = 0.007); for neopterin, the postoperative decrease was not statistically significant (19.42 nmol\/L vs. 10.92 nmol\/L, p = 0.06). No significant association with the hospitalization period was observed. Neopterin may be a useful biomarker for complicated cholecystitis, and chitotriosidase may have prognostic utility in early patient follow-up.","29":"It is difficult to directly obtain pathological diagnosis of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA). Analysis of bile in the pCCA microenvironment, based on metabolomics and statistical methods, can help in clinical diagnosis. Clinical information, bile samples, blood liver function, blood CA199, CEA, and other indicators were collected from 33 patients with pCCA and 16 patients with gallstones. Bile samples were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics methods. A combination of multivariate and univariate analyses were used to screen for potential differential metabolites Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment and differential metabolite remodeling, we explored changes in the pCCA pathway and potential therapeutic targets. There were significant differences in patient blood TBIL, ALT, AST, TBA, CA19-9, and CEA indices (p < 0.05, |log2(fc)| >\/= 1) between two groups. A significant correlation was found between these different indicators by Spearman's analysis. The clinical parameters were correlated with mass-to-charge ratios of 305 (Positive Ion Mode, POS) and 246 (Negative Ion Mode, NEG) in the metabolic group (|r| >\/= 0.7, P <\/= 10(-7)). The result of this study indicated that bile untargeted metabolomics combined with statistical analysis techniques may be used for diagnose and treatment of pCCA.","30":"Mirizzi syndrome is a rare condition caused by the obstruction of the common bile duct or common hepatic duct by external compression from multiple impacted gallstones or a single large impacted gallstone in Hartman's pouch. The condition can easily be confused with choledocholithiasis, bile duct stricture or cholangiocarcinoma due to the presence of obstructive jaundice hence may be overlooked due to the rarity of the condition. The incidence of Mirizzi syndrome among patients with gallstones is reported to range from 0.63 to 5.7%. Furthermore, it poses a differential diagnosis dilemma for the physician as well as radiologists because there are no clinical features or diagnostic procedures that have a 100% specificity and sensitivity. Laparotomy is the preferred surgical technique of choice. For the patients who are poor surgical candidate, mainstay of treatment is biliary stent placement for the restoration of normal biliary drainage. Due to low incidence of the Mirizzi syndrome, an elevated index of suspicion is required to diagnose this condition. At present, there are no well-developed, internationally recognized clinical guidelines for the management of this syndrome. Furthermore, the diagnostic procedures available still pose a barrier in the ability to confirm the diagnosis prior to surgical treatment, even though the diagnostic rate has increased dramatically.","31":"PURPOSE: The Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI(R)) are both widely used methods for reporting postoperative complications. Several studies have compared the CCI(R) with the CDC in evaluating postoperative complications of major abdominal surgery. However, there are no published reports comparing both indexes in single-stage laparoscopic common bile duct exploration with cholecystectomy (LCBDE) for the treatment of common bile duct stones. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of the CCI(R) and the CDC in evaluating the complications of LCBDE. METHODS: In total, 249 patients were included. Spearman's rank test was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between CCI(R) and CDC with length of postoperative stay (LOS), reoperation, readmission, and mortality rates. Student t-test and Fisher's exact test were used to study, if higher ASA, age, larger surgical time, history of previous abdominal surgery, preoperative ERCP, and intraoperative cholangitis finding were associated with higher CDC grade or higher CCI(R) score. RESULTS: Mean CCI(R) was 5.17 +\/- 12.8. CCI(R) ranges overlap among three CDC grades: II (20.90-36.20), IIIa (26.20-34.60), and IIIb (33.70-52.10). Age > 60 years, ASA >\/= III, and intraoperative cholangitis finding were associated with higher CCI(R) (p = 0.010, p = 0.044, and p = 0.031) but not with CDC >\/= IIIa (p = 0.158, p = 0.209, and p = 0.062). In patients with complications, LOS presented a significantly higher correlation with CCI(R) than with CDC (p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: In LCBDE, the CCI(R) assesses better the magnitude of postoperative complications in patients older than 60 years, with a high ASA as well as in those who present intraoperative cholangitis. In addition, the CCI(R) correlates better with LOS in patients with complications.","32":"AIM: This review aims to summarize the state of the art in endoscopic and other minimally invasive technique for the treatment of acute biliary pancreatitis. Current indications, advantages or disadvantages for each reported technique and future perspectives are discussed. BACKGROUND: Acute biliary pancreatitis is one of the most common gastroenterological diseases. Its management range from medical to interventional treatment and involves gastroenterologists, nutritionists, endoscopists, interventional radiologists and surgeons. Interventional procedures are required in case of local complications, failure of medical treatment and definitive treatment of biliary gallstones. Endoscopic and minimally invasive procedures have progressively gained favor and wide diffusion in treating acute biliary pancreatitis reporting good results in terms of safety and minor morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is advocated in case of cholangitis and persistent common biliary duct obstruction. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the definitive treatment for acute biliary pancreatitis. Endoscopic transmural drainage and necrosectomy have gained acceptance and diffusion in treating pancreatic necrosis reporting minor impact on morbidity respect surgery. A surgical approach to pancreatic necrosis progressively shifts towards minimally invasive technique like minimally access retroperitoneal pancreatic necrosectomy, video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement or laparoscopic necrosectomy. Open necrosectomy in necrotizing pancreatitis is reserved to failure of endoscopic or minimally invasive treatment or in case of wide necrotic collections.

This study aimed to determine the clinical relationship between obesity and acute gastrointestinal injury in earlystage acute pancreatitis. METHODS: This was a prospective study that enrolled 194 acute pancreatitis patients. RESULTS: The median body mass index was 26.5 (7.0) kg\/m2. Considering etiology of acute pancreatitis, 90 patients had gallstones, 48 had hypertriglyceridemia, 36 were alcohol users, and 20 were others. A total of 116 patients had mild acute pancreatitis and the rest had severe acute pancreatitis. The median of bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis score was 1 (2) and the serum concentration of C-reactive protein was 80.5 (60.0) mg\/L. Acute pancreatitis was accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction in 60 cases and by pancreatic necrosis in 34. A total of 52 patients were admitted to intensive care unit. The values of body mass index were higher in patients with severe acute pancreatitis than those with mild acute pancreatitis. A similar trend emerged in patients with hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis compared to other causes. Body mass index had a positive relationship with bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis scores. Noticeably, body mass index was statistically raised from gastrointestinal injury grade 1 to grade 4. The values of body mass index also showed relevance with intestinal barrier function evaluated by d-lactate, diamine oxidase, and intestinal fatty acid binding proteins. Furthermore, body mass indexes were statistically higher in patients having adverse outcomes of acute pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: This prospective study showed that obesity might contribute to increasing the severity of acute pancreatitis and aggravate subsequent intestinal injury in early-stage acute pancreatitis.","34":"&lt;b&gt; Aim: &lt;\/b&gt; The study was conducted to analyse the recent peer-reviewed literature related to symptomatic spilled gallstones after Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC). &lt;\/br&gt;&lt;\/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;\/b&gt; Articles published in the peer-reviewed journals of repute from 20122022 were evaluated for nine variables including: [I] age of the patient, [II] gender, [III] interval since index LC, [IV] index LC if emergent\/difficult or elective\/straightforward, [V] clinical presentation, [VI] spilled gallstones if detected by imaging, [VII] management, [VIII] approach to management, [IX] number of spilled gallstones. &lt;\/br&gt;&lt;\/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;\/b&gt; There were a total of 71 cases (37 males and 34 females) with a mean age of 63.7 years. The time of onset of symptoms from spilled gallstones, after index LC, ranged from 2 days to 15 years and 57 patients (80.3%) presented within 6 years. Forty (56.3%) patients were unaware of the fact that gallstone spillage had occurred during index LC. The retained gallstones were detected by imaging in 47 (66.1%) cases and they were multiple in 51 (71.8%). In 52 patients (73.2%), the stones manifested as abdominal abscess\/foreign body granuloma; the other presentations being pelvic pain\/fistula, intestinal obstruction, abdominal lump simulating malignancy, incidental finding of metastatic lesions and generalized peritonitis. The major approaches adopted to retrieve the retained stones included open surgery, laparoscopy and percutaneous drainage. There were two deaths (2.9%) due to spilled gallstones. &lt;\/br&gt;&lt;\/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;\/b&gt; Retained gallstones represent a complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) that has a potential to create morbidity and diagnostic difficulties, even after a substantial delay. There is a need to spread awareness about the adverse effects of spilled stones so that they are actively looked for and retrieved if gallbladder perforates during cholecystectomy. Whenever such a complication occurs, the patient should be properly informed and the details should be very clearly mentioned in the operation notes.","35":"Surgical community has not yet reached any consensus on the adequate treatment of gallstone disease with combined stones of the gallbladder and bile ducts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic papillosphincterotomy (EPST) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCE) have been considered the optimal treatment method for the past thirty years. Thanks to improvement of technologies and experience in laparoscopic surgery, many centers in the world offer simultaneous treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis, i.e. LCE and laparoscopic choledocholithotomy. Transcystical and transcholedochal extraction of calculi from the common bile duct is the most common. Intraoperative cholangiography and choledochoscopy are used to assess extraction of calculi while T-shaped drainage, biliary stent and primary suture of common bile duct are used to complete choledocholithotomy. Laparoscopic choledocholithotomy is associated with certain difficulties, requires some experience in choledochoscopy and intracorporeal suturing of common bile duct. There are many unresolved issues regarding the choice of laparoscopic choledocholithotomy technique depending on the number and dimensions of stones, diameter of cystic duct and common bile duct. The authors analyze literature data on the role of modern minimally invasive interventions in the treatment of gallstone disease.","36":"This study aims to evaluate the relation between the cystocholedochal angle (SCA) and choledocholithiasis. The data of 3.350 patients were reviewed retrospectively and a total of 628 patients who met the criteria were included in the study. The patients included in the study were divided into three groups as patients with choledocholithiasis (Group I), patients with only cholelithiasis (Group II), and patients without gallstones as control group (Group III). Measurements of SCA, cystic, bile, and common hepatic ducts (CHDs) were made on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) images. Laboratory findings and demographic characteristics of the patients were also recorded. Of the patients included in the study 64.2% were female, 35.8% were male, and their age ranged from 18 to 93 (mean 53.37 +\/- 18.87 years). While the mean SCA values of all patient groups were 35.44 degrees  +\/- 10.44 degrees , the mean length of cystic, bile and CHDs were 28.91 +\/- 9.30, 40.28 +\/- 12.91, 27.09 +\/- 9.68 mm respectively. All measurements were higher in Group I in comparison to other groups, whereas all measurements of Group II were higher than those of Group III (p < 0.001). Statistical analysis suggests that a SCA of 33.5 degrees  and above is an important criterion for diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. Increase of SCA raises the likelihood of choledocholithiasis, as it facilitates the passage of stones from gallbladder into the bile ducts. This is the first study to compare SCA in patients with choledocholithiasis and those with only cholelithiasis. Therefore, we think that this study is important and will be a guide for clinical evaluation.","37":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence regarding the relation of exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) with gallstone disease (GSD) risk remains lacking. We tested the hypothesis that long-term exposure to PM is related to the development of GSD and that dyslipidemia can mediate the effect of PM-associated GSD formation. METHODS: We extracted related information on the basis of the baseline survey of the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study. The exposure levels of PM (PM(1), PM(2.5), and PM(10)) were assessed by validated spatiotemporal models. The relation of exposure to ambient PM with GSD risks was analyzed by non-conditional logistic regression models. Additionally, mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether dyslipidemia was related to the relation of PM exposure with GSD risks. RESULTS: A total of 72,893 participants were included. Increased ambient PM exposure was positively associated with a higher GSD risk, with ORs (and 95% CI) of 1.17 (1.06, 1.28), 1.10 (1.05, 1.15), and 1.07 (1.04, 1.10) for every 10 mug\/m(3) increment in PM(1), PM(2.5), and PM(10), separately. The association was more remarkable in males, drinkers, and central obesity participants. Dyslipidemia significantly mediated the association between PM and GSD, with mediating proportions of 5.37%, 9.13%, and 7.66% in PM(1), PM(2.5), and PM(10), respectively. CONCLUSION: Exposure to PM may relate to the increased risk of GSD in Chinese adults, especially among males, drinkers, and central obesity participants. Dyslipidemia may partially mediate the effect of PM-associated GSD development. Our results might provide epidemiological evidence for the progression of GSD related to PM and give new insights into GSD prevention and screening priorities.","38":"Harmful particles such as heavy metal particles in the human body can cause many problems such as kidney stones, gallstones, and cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, it is critical to separate them from the blood and perform a systematic analysis as early as possible. Here, we apply eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) microparticles as a model to study the separation of particles from blood, thanks to their properties of low toxicity, excellent degradability, and negligible vapor pressure. In particular, the dielectrophoresis (DEP) separation method is employed to separate EGaIn of different sizes and characteristics in blood. First, the screen-printing method is used to create EGaIn microparticles with diameters of 15, 23, 18, and 11 mum. According to the lifetime test, these microparticles can last more than 1 month, as evidenced by their surface oxidation characteristics. Moreover, a DEP platform with W-type electrodes is developed to sort EGaIn particles from whole human blood. The results show that a sorting efficiency of 95% can be attained, which is similar to the separation efficiency of 98% achieved by finite element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL software based on the orthogonal array experiment method. The proposed study successfully validates the use of the DEP method to separate particles from human blood, providing insights into heavy metal particle separating, drug screening, and cell sorting and potentially broadening the applications in environmental analysis, food engineering, and bioengineering.","39":"Candidates of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) are prone for gallstone formation. Concomitant cholecystectomy (CC) during MBS is controversial. This study is first to examine the safety of CC during one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), compared with sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Single-center retrospective comparative study of CC (2012-2021) during OAGB, to SG and RYGB. CC was performed in 115 patients during OAGB (n = 50), SG (n = 39), and RYGB (n = 26). All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Baseline characteristics were similar except age, body mass index, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and previous MBS (p < 0.05). Intraoperative complications occurred in one OAGB patient (2% vs. 0%, 0%; p = 0.52), which was not cholecystectomy related. There were no differences in total (6% vs. 2.6%, 15.4%; p = 0.13) and major (2% vs. 0%, 3.8; p = 0.50) early-complication rates. Of them, cholecystectomy-related complications occurred in one OAGB, compared with none of SG and one RYGB (2% vs. 0%, 3.8%; p = 0.50). The former was major, and the latter was minor complication. None of the OAGB patients needed re-admission (0% vs. 0%, 11.5; p = 0.04). All CC outcome parameters were similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic gallstones. Previous bariatric procedures were found to be a significant risk for major complications and readmissions (OR = 16.87, p = 0.019). CC during OAGB for gallstones seems safe, as in SG and RYGB. No cholecystectomy-related intraoperative complications occurred, and postoperative complication rates were low and acceptable. Outcomes for asymptomatic gallstones were similar to symptomatic ones, and we cautiously support CC in the presence of gallstones.","40":"The rising incidence combined with pregnancy-related physiological changes make gallbladder and biliary pathology high on the differential for pregnant patients presenting with right upper abdominal pain. Imaging plays a crucial role in determining surgical versus non-surgical management in pregnant patients with biliary or gallbladder pathology. Ultrasound (first-line) and magnetic resonance with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (second-line) are the imaging techniques of choice in pregnant patients with suspected biliary pathology due to their lack of ionizing radiation. MRI\/MRCP offers an excellent non-invasive imaging option, providing detailed anatomical detail without known harmful fetal side effects. This article reviews physiological changes in pregnancy that lead to gallstone and biliary pathology, key imaging findings on US and MRI\/MRCP, and management pathways.","41":"BACKGROUND: Factors of metabolic syndrome such as obesity are well-known risk factors for gallstone disease (GSD). There are different indicators of obesity, including weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio. The predictive ability of different obesity indicators for GSD remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the most efficient predictor of GSD among the different anthropometric indicators of obesity. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 2263 participants who completed a questionnaire detailing their demographics, medical history, and lifestyle between 2014 and 2017 in Taiwan. Blood samples were collected and physical examinations, including anthropometric measurements, were performed. Gallstone disease was ascertained using ultrasonography. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for GSD. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GSD was 8.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, individuals with a waist-to-height ratio >\/=0.5 (odds ratio|odds ratios (OR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.48, p = 0.017) had an increased risk of GSD. Diabetes was the main risk factor for GSD in men (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.17-3.65, p = 0.013). Among women, waist-to-height ratio >0.5 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.03-3.02, p = 0.040) and current hormone drug use (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.09-6.84, p = 0.033) were significant risk factors for gallstones. CONCLUSION: GSD was independently associated with central obesity and exogenous hormone intake in women. Among the anthropometric indicators used to assess central obesity, waist-to-height ratio was the most accurate predictor of GSD.","42":"Lemmel syndrome is an uncommon pancreaticobiliary consequence of duodenal diverticula. We herein present a case of an 80-year-old male who presented with upper abdominal discomfort. Based on lab values and relevant clinical history, a diagnosis of obstructive jaundice was made. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed gross dilatation of intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic bile duct, cystic duct, common bile duct, major and minor pancreatic duct. A contrast-filled outpouching was seen from the medial wall of the second part of the duodenum with duodenal diverticulum and papilla within it. The abrupt termination of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct adjacent to the thickened wall of the diverticulum was the cause of the patient's pancreaticobiliary obstruction. In the absence of cholelithiasis or tumor, the duodenal diverticulum that manifests as obstructive jaundice is known as Lemmel syndrome. Prompt identification of Lemmel syndrome can avoid dangerous complications and unnecessary investigations. Gallstones, cholangitis, and bile duct stones are more common in patients with duodenal diverticula. Treatment depends on patient presentation and may involve conservative management, surgical procedures in the form of excision of the diverticulum, or even endoscopic sphincterotomy or stenting.","43":"Introduction Accurate diagnosis and prompt definitive management of choledocholithiasis are vital in acute gallstone pancreatitis. The sensitivity of detection of choledocholithiasis varies across imaging modalities. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is the most sensitive but may not be necessary, resulting in both delayed definitive management and increased costs. We aimed to evaluate the range of radiological investigations patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis underwent and the clinical appropriateness of MRCP when performed. Methods This was an observational study of patients diagnosed with acute gallstone pancreatitis between January 1, 2019 and November 30, 2021 in a district general hospital in London, UK. A detailed review of patient records, laboratory and radiological results, and endoscopic and\/or operative intervention was undertaken. Results One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with acute gallstone pancreatitis (median age 57 years) were included. Seventy-nine had a transabdominal ultrasound (USS), 46 had CT, and 40 patients had MRCP. The median waiting time for these investigations was 1, 0, and 4 days, respectively. Choledocholithiasis was identified in 21 patients (4 on USS, 5 on CT, and 12 on MRCP). As definitive management, 37% underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and 57% underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A total of 19% of patients were readmitted with pancreatitis prior to definitive management. Conclusions First-line imaging investigations such as USS and CT can detect some cases of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis, but not all. Despite expenses in terms of cost and length of hospital stay, MRCP remains an essential resource to detect cases of choledocholithiasis not captured by USS or CT. We recommend establishing a guideline to streamline imaging in assessing acute gallstone pancreatitis.","44":"BACKGROUND: Current adult guidelines in the management of choledocholithiasis (CDL) may not be appropriate for children. We hypothesized adult preoperative predictive factors are not reliable for predicting CDL in children. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed evaluating children (<\/=18 years of age) who underwent cholecystectomy for gallstone disease at 10 children's hospitals. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to identify factors independently associated with CDL. Patients were stratified into risk groups demonstrating based on the presence of predictive factors for CDL. Statistical analyses were performed, and chi-square analyses were used with a significance of p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 979 cholecystectomy patients were analyzed. The diagnosis of CDL was confirmed in 222 patients (22.7%) by MRCP, ERCP, or IOC. Three predictive factors were identified 1) D ilated common bile duct (CBD) >\/=6mm, 2) U ltrasound (US) with C holedocholithiasis, and 3) T otal bilirubin >\/=1.8 mg\/dL (Pediatric DUCT criteria). Risk groups were based on the number of predictive factors: Very High (3), High (2), Intermediate (1) and Low (0). The Pediatric DUCT criteria demonstrated accuracies of >76%, specificity of >78%, and negative predictive values of >79%. Adult factors (elevated AST\/ALT, pancreatitis, BMI, and age) did not independently predict CDL. Based on risk stratification, the high and very-high risk groups demonstrated higher predictive capacity for CDL. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the Pediatric DUCT criteria, incorporating CBD dilation, choledocholithiasis seen on US, and total bilirubin >\/=1.8 mg\/dL, highly predicts the presence of choledocholithiasis in children. Other adult preoperative factors are not predictive of CBD stones in children.","45":"BACKGROUND Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is caused by a breach of the blood-ocular barrier by pathogens originating from distant infective foci. Here, we report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis due to cholangitis complicated by common bile duct stones, which is a rare source of infection. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus underwent endoscopic choledocholithotripsy 20 years ago and laparoscopic cholecystectomy 18 years ago. He had choledocholith-related cholangitis 6, 5, and 1 years previously and 4 times in the last year and underwent endoscopic choledocholithotripsy each time. Three days after the last surgery, the patient developed right endogenous endophthalmitis and vitrectomy was performed. Four months later, the patient relapsed with cholangitis and required surgery for recurrent endophthalmitis. Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy was performed with curative intent, and the patient was followed up for 5 years without recurrence of choledocholith, cholangitis, or endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS The recommended treatment strategy for patients diagnosed with common bile duct stones or choledocholithiasis is stone extraction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with endoscopic intervention is a widely accepted procedure. However, in cases of recurrent choledocholithiasis, the rate of recurrence increases and the interval between ERCP becomes shorter in proportion to the number of recurrences. In such intractable cases requiring numerous sessions of endoscopic stone removal, bypass Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy should be performed to prevent possible rare complications such as endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis.","46":"Cystic artery pseudoaneurysm (CAP) is a very rare complication of acute cholecystitis. The pathogenesis of CAP in the context of cholecystitis is unknown but is possibly related to the inflammatory process in the vicinity of the cystic artery, leading to weakness in the wall of the artery. Though CAP has been reported in the literature, our patient had a unique presentation in the presence of a cholecystostomy catheter in situ. There were no risk factors for CAP in our patient including usage of anticoagulants, trauma, or surgical procedures. Fortunately, the blood-stained fluid in the cholecystostomy catheter effluent alerted the clinical team to a possible vascular complication in the background of ongoing cholecystitis. This finding should serve as a warning sign to alert clinicians to the possibility of CAP-beware of rattling underfoot.","47":"Cholecysto-antral fistula and gallstone ileus are rare complications of a common disease, gallbladder stone (GBS). This fistula is developed as a prolonged complication of cholelithiasis in which the gallbladder adheres to the adjacent antrum, and a stone erodes through the wall. Among the variety of cholecystoenteric fistulae, the cholecystoduodenal fistula occurs more commonly than the cholesysto-antral fistula. In this scientific study, we present a 98-year-old male patient who came to ER with a complaint of abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation for five days. He was vitally stable and had normal laboratory results. The plain abdominal X-ray showed dilated loops with excessive gases. His computed tomography (CT) abdomen with contrast showed small bowel obstruction secondary to an impacted gallstone at the distal jejunum, fistulous communication between the gall bladder and the antrum, and pneumobilia. Our management included endoscopic retrieval of a single gallstone from the second part of the duodenum followed by open surgical enterolithotomy, partial cholecystectomy, and closing of the fistula. Despite our case sharing many aspects with the available literature, our case, to our knowledge, is the first case of ileus gallstone occurring in a 98-year-old patient. Cholecysto-antral fistula has not been widely published in the literature. The offending gallstone presented along with the radiological Mercedes Benz sign which does not present in all cases of GBS. Typically, the obstructing GBS stops at the terminal ileum, but in our case, it was dislodged in the distal jejunum with no previous biliary symptoms. Finally, we were able to remove another single GBS from the second part of the duodenum during the preoperative upper endoscopy. The clinical diagnosis may be missed due to the vague presentation of symptoms; hence imaging, especially of the CT abdomen is crucial in establishing the diagnosis, moreover, performing an upper endoscopy could have diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. In cases like this, the main surgical intervention should be to address the bowel obstruction, and cholecystectomy with fistula closure may be added if the patient's condition is stable with minimal inflammation and adhesion.","48":"Gallstone ileus is a rare entity and constitutes an uncommon complication of gallstone disease. It is caused by the impaction of a gallstone in the gastrointestinal tract and may cause serious symptoms or even life-threatening complications. It should be part of the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen especially in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction and known gallstone disease. An early diagnosis is essential, and surgical treatment is the gold standard in order to relieve the obstruction. We present the case of an 84-year-old male patient with gallstone ileus due to cholecysto-intestinal fistula and impacted gallstone at jejunum. He was treated via urgent enterolithotomy, and his post-operative period was uneventful. This report aims to further educate clinical doctors on this rare medical condition which may pose a potentially serious health risk.","49":"OBJECTIVES: To further investigate how sevoflurane affects the oxidative stress injury (OSI) in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out at Shandong Provincial Third Hospital, Jinan, China on 82 gallstone patients who underwent LC, with sevoflurane maintenance during surgery. Genotyping analysis of the rs145204276 polymorphism was performed using the TaqMan platform. Oxidative stress injury and liver injury parameters were also examined. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages, which were challenged with sevoflurane, propofol, or the lncRNA-GAS5 overexpressing plasmid, were used to evaluate the effect of Sevoflurane on lncRNA-GAS5-mediated macrophage polarization. RESULTS: At TM1 and TM2, the levels of OSI markers and long noncoding (lnc) RNA-GAS5 were not obviously different, whereas at the TM3 time point, these indices were significantly different between the Del-Sevoflurane and Del-Propofol subgroups. These indices were not different between the Ins-sevoflurane and Ins-Propofol subgroups at any time point. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that Sevoflurane could increased the lncRNA-GAS5 level in LPS-induced Del-macrophages (p=0.0058), but Propofol did not have this effect (p=0.847). Both Sevoflurane and Propofol did not have the effect on lncRNA-GAS5 level in LPS-induced Ins-macrophages (p=0.321 and p=0.822, respectively). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane maintenance can decrease OSI during LC in the Del genotype of the rs145204276 polymorphism. The Del genotype facilitates lncRNA-GAS5 up-regulation under Sevoflurane exposure and therefore decrease the extent of M1 macrophage polarization.","50":null,"51":"BACKGROUND: TikTok was an important channel for consumers to access and adopt health information. But the quality of health content in TikTok remains underinvestigated. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify upload sources, contents, and feature information of gallstone disease videos on TikTok and further evaluated the factors related to video quality. METHODS: We investigated the first 100 gallstone-related videos on TikTok and analyzed these videos' upload sources, content, and characteristics. The quality of videos was evaluated using quantitative scoring tools such as DISCERN instrument, the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and Global Quality Scores (GQS). Moreover, the correlation between video quality and video characteristics, including duration, likes, comments, and shares, was further investigated. RESULTS: According to video sources, 81% of the videos were posted by doctors. Furthermore, disease knowledge was the most dominant video content, accounting for 56% of all the videos. The mean DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS scores of all 100 videos are 39.61 (SD 11.36), 2.00 (SD 0.40), and 2.76 (SD 0.95), respectively. According to DISCERN and GQS, gallstone-related videos' quality score on TikTok is not high, mainly at fair (43\/100, 43%,) and moderate (46\/100, 46%). The total DISCERN scores of doctors were significantly higher than that of individuals and news agencies, surgery techniques were significantly higher than lifestyle and news, and disease knowledge was significantly higher than news, respectively. DISCERN scores and video duration were positively correlated. Negative correlations were found between DISCERN scores and likes and shares of videos. In GQS analysis, no significant differences were found between groups based on different sources or different contents. JAMA was excluded in the video quality and correlation analysis due to a lack of discrimination and inability to evaluate the video quality accurately. CONCLUSIONS: Although the videos of gallstones on TikTok are mainly provided by doctors and contain disease knowledge, they are of low quality. We found a positive correlation between video duration and video quality. High-quality videos received low attention, and popular videos were of low quality. Medical information on TikTok is currently not rigorous enough to guide patients to make accurate judgments. TikTok was not an appropriate source of knowledge to educate patients due to the low quality and reliability of the information.","52":"PURPOSE: This paper describes the initial experience with a PTFE-covered microplug to perform extravascular embolizations in patients with iatrogenic biliary leaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter analysis has been conducted on seven patients. All were symptomatic for abdominal pain and had an abdominal drainage adjacent to the supposed site of leakage. The biliary output of the drainage was monitored daily. Biliary leak etiology was iatrogenic: four after laparoscopic cholecistectomy for gallstones, one after explorative laparotomy for pancreas head adenocarcinoma with concomitant cholecistectomy for gallstones, and two after long-standing internal-external right biliary drainage for cholangiocarcinoma. In four cases leakage sourced from cystic duct stump, in one from an aberrant bile duct and in two from bilio-cutaneous fistula. Technical success was considered leak resolution at the last cholangiography. Clinical success was defined improvement in the clinical conditions together with progressive resolution of the biliary output from the abdominal drainage until removal. RESULTS: Technical and clinical successes were 100%. A 5 mm microplug was adopted in five cases of post-cholecistectomy leaks. A 3 mm microplug and a 9 mm microplug were deployed in the two cases of peripheral leaks related to bilio-cutaneous fistulas. In three patients additional embolics (coils in two cases; spongel slurry in one case) were required. Minor complications occurred in three patients. CONCLUSION: This initial experience on seven patients with iatrogenic biliary leaks demonstrated that percutaneous transhepatic PTFE-covered microplug embolization is technically feasible and clinically effective to achieve leak resolution. Future researches with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.","53":"Cholecystocholedocholithiasis is a common disease worldwide; however, there is still no consensus regarding a gold standard therapy for its management. Nowadays, the preferred method is a \"two-step\" process, starting with an endoscopic common bile duct (CBD) stone extraction (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) followed by a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Nevertheless, this \"two-step\" approach has shown some difficulties over time (i.e., need for two hospital admissions, need of at least two anesthesia inductions, higher rate of post-procedural pancreatitis, longer hospitalizations and thus, increased costs). On the other hand, the laparo-endoscopic rendezvous (LER), which is a simultaneous combined procedure for removing the gallbladder laparoscopically and clearing the CBD endoscopically, is another valid treatment modality that involves a \"single-step\" resolution of cholecystocholedocholithiasis applying a multidisciplinary approach of the patient. The aim of this study was to present our initial outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed eleven patients who consecutively underwent LER at our institution from May 2017 to March 2022. The patients' mean age was 50.6 years old (range, 34 - 68) and most were male 54.5% (6\/11). LER successfully achieved CBD stone clearance in 90.9% (10\/11) of the cases. Post-LER pancreatitis was not recorded in any case. Post-operative complications included one reoperation (1\/11; 9.1%) due to bleeding from one of the laparoscopic trocar sites. Our group concluded that LER can be effectively applied in Peru with good mid-term results and confirmed its effectiveness in accomplishing CBD stone clearance. Based on our results, we recommend the use of LER as a safe and valid therapeutic option for our patients.","54":"Acute gallstone pancreatitis is a rare occurrence in pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, gallstone pancreatitis should be considered in a differential diagnosis for right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain in this population, as the risk of biliary stasis and gallstone formation increases in pregnancy due to high levels of circulating estrogen causing increased cholesterol formation and delayed gallbladder emptying. Although gallstones are the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in pregnancy, alcohol use and hypertriglyceridemia may also be considered. In this case report, we present a G1P0 female pregnant with monochorionic diamniotic twins who developed postpartum acute gallstone pancreatitis status post Cesarean section.","55":"Gallstone ileus is an unusual cause of small bowel obstruction, in general, let alone after cholecystectomy. It occurs in patients with chronic calculous cholecystitis and gallstones who develop a cholecystoduodenal fistula over time. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation and examination findings and is confirmed with the use of radiological modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) scan, which has been proven to be the most sensitive investigation in diagnosis. Here, we present a case of gallstone ileus that occurred 25 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CT scan on admission showed adhesional small bowel obstruction given the patient's previous abdominal surgery. The patient was managed conservatively as per guidelines for the management of adhesional small bowel obstruction for 72 hours. Obstructive symptoms did not resolve despite all conservative measures, and a gastrografin challenge showed no contrast reaching the colon. Hence, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy to manage his ongoing bowel obstruction. Laparotomy revealed gallstone ileus as the cause of obstruction. This case highlights the importance of considering gallstone ileus in the differential diagnosis for patients who present to the emergency department with small bowel obstruction even years after cholecystectomy. Post-cholecystectomy gallstone ileus is very rare with very few cases reported in the literature. This condition poses diagnostic challenges both because of its rarity and because the gallbladder had been previously removed. A high index of suspicion by the surgeon is needed for diagnosis.","56":"Gallstone ileus is a rare presentation of gallbladder disease. It is mostly encountered in female and elderly patients. It occurs when a stone causes a fistula between the gallbladder and the intestinal lumen. More than half of the patients do not have a history of biliary disease. Surgical intervention is still considered the best treatment option; however, the best choice between one-stage and two-stage surgery is still unknown. We present a gallstone Ileus case in a patient with uncommon epidemiological characteristics: a 28-year-old male Hispanic patient without a gallbladder disease history.","57":null,"58":"An 86-year-old woman who suffered from cardiac tamponade due to acute Stanford type A aortic dissection was admitted to our hospital. An emergency operation was performed uneventfully. She suffered from abdominal pain 13 days after the operation. Computed tomography( CT) scan revealed pericholecystic fluid and unclear gallbladder wall, revealing acalculous necrotizing cholecystitis. We performed open cholecystectomy and abdominal cavity drainage. No gallstones were observed. She underwent intensive treatment. She was discharged without complications 44 days after the cholecystectomy.","59":"OBJECTIVE: The population of Latin America harbors the highest incidence of gallstones and acute biliary pancreatitis, yet little is known about the initial management of acute pancreatitis in this large geographic region. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of responses from physicians based in Latin America to the international multidisciplinary survey on the initial management of acute pancreatitis. The questionnaire asked about management of patients during the first 72h after admission, related to fluid therapy, prescription of prophylactic antibiotics, feeding and nutrition, and timing of cholecystectomy. Adherence to clinical guidelines in this region was compared with the rest of the world. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 358 participants from 19 Latin American countries (median age, 39 years [33-47]; women, 27.1%). The proportion of participants in Latin America vs. the rest of the world who chose non-compliant options with clinical guidelines were: prescription of fluid therapy rate other than moderate (42.2% vs 34.3%, P=.02); prescription of prophylactic antibiotics for severe (10.6% vs 18.0%, P=.002), necrotizing (28.5% vs 36.9%, P=.008), or systemic inflammatory response syndrome-associated (21.2% vs 30.6%, P=.002) acute pancreatitis; not starting an oral diet to patients with oral tolerance (77.9% vs 71.1%, P=.02); and delayed cholecystectomy (16.2% vs 33.8%, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed physicians in Latin America are less likely to prescribe antibiotics and to delay cholecystectomy when managing patients in the initial phase of acute pancreatitis compared to physicians in the rest of the world. Feeding and nutrition appear to require the greatest improvement.","60":"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates an association between NAFLD and gallstone disease (GD), while some does not support this. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the bidirectional association between NAFLD and GD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2022. The association was analyzed based on the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with Reviewer Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 284,512 participants met the criteria for GD predicting the onset of NAFLD. GD patients had a higher incidence of NAFLD (OR:1.48, CI:1.32-1.65, p < 0.00001), especially the incidence of moderate-to-severe NAFLD (OR:1.63; CI:1.40-1.79), with females at a higher risk (OR: 1.84; CI: 1.48-2.29). The inverse association was explored in eight studies involving 326,922 participants. The GD incidence in NAFLD patients was higher (OR:1.71, CI:1.63-1.79, p < 0.00001) and may increase due to female sex (OR: 4.18; CI: 1.21-14.37) and high BMI (OR: 1.80; CI: 1.36-2.56), compared with the non-NAFLD group. Besides, this bidirectional association was also confirmed in the Chinese population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings supported positive concurrent and bidirectional relationships between NAFLD and GD. Therefore, clinicians may alert the possibility of NAFLD in patients with GD and vice versa.","61":null,"62":"CONTEXT: While laparoscopy has been the standard procedure for gallstone treatment, recent advances including the use of indocyanine green (ICG) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy have made it easier to understand the biliary tree and reduce the risk of bile duct injury. AIMS: In this retrospective study, we aim to determine the efficacy of ICG in near-infrared fluorescence cholangiography (NIRFC) for visualising biliary anatomy. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 90 patients with the symptoms of cholelithiasis were enrolled for this retrospective study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All the patients underwent cholecystectomy approximately 53.8 min (40-90 min) after the intravenous administration of mean volume 1.6 ml (1-2 ml) ICG. The surgeons used NIRFC along with ICG for real-time visualisation of biliary anatomy. RESULTS: The mean operative time for the surgery was 65.7 min (25-120 min) with no post-surgical complications observed in the patients. The average length of stay was 2 days (1-3 days). ICG usage with NIRFC enabled identification of cystic duct, common hepatic and common bile duct, the junction between common hepatic and bile duct, right and left hepatic duct in 87.7%, 94.4%, 80% and 14.4% of cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ICG fluorescence allowed successful visualisation of at least 1 biliary structure in 100% of cases.","63":"Gallstone ileus is an uncommon condition that is difficult to diagnose clinically. Although several cases have been reported in the literature, radiolucent gallstones in the setting of gallstone ileus are an exceedingly rare occurrence, and we have not identified any authors who used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the acute diagnosis of this condition. While an MRI is the gold standard for visualizing gallstones, inpatient MRIs are difficult to obtain, even in resource-rich settings. However, if given a high index of suspicion for gallstone ileus, it is pertinent to advocate for an inpatient MRI despite a resolution of patients' symptoms due to the nature of the disease symptomology.","64":null,"65":"BACKGROUND: Gallstone disease remains a major health issue. There have been significant changes in the management and demographics of patients with these conditions. We aimed to evaluate trends in hospitalization, management, and post-procedural adverse events for patients with gallstone disease. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample was used to identify discharges for symptomatic cholelithiasis and cholecystitis between 2005 and 2014. Temporal trends were evaluated by calculating annual percent changes (APCs). Joinpoint regression was used to assess inflection points. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate associations between urban and rural divisions and mortality, use of interventional procedures, and post-procedural adverse events. RESULTS: From 77,394,755 unweighted discharges, there was a decline in discharges for cholelithiasis (APC - 5.5%, 95% confidence intervals, CI, - 7.6 to - 3.4%) and cholecystitis from 2012 to 2014 (APC - 4.5%, 95% CI - 7.2 to - 1.7%). Interventions were more likely at urban hospitals for symptomatic cholelithiasis (odds ratio, OR, 1.49, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.66) and cholecystitis (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.05). In-hospital mortality significantly decreased annually for patients with cholecystitis (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.93). In-hospital mortality between rural and urban centers was comparable for symptomatic cholelithiasis (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.03) and cholecystitis (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for gallstone disease have decreased since the 2010s. In-hospital mortality between urban and rural centers is similar, but urban hospitals utilize a higher rate of procedural interventions. Future studies should evaluate practice trends and costs across inpatient and ambulatory settings between rural and urban divisions.","66":"INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease mainly affects African Americans, and studies on racial differences in sickle cell disease outcomes are scanty. This study examined racial and ethnic differences in sickle cell disease prevalence, comorbidities, and outcomes. METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2016 to 2018, we identified patients' records with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The overall study population was further stratified by race into Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics. Using logistic regression, comorbidities and outcomes among sickle cell disease patients were compared between the three races\/ethnicities. RESULTS: Of the 74 817 hospitalized for sickle cell disease, 69 889 (93.4%) were Blacks, 3603 (4.8%) were Hispanics, and 1325 (1.8%) were Whites. Compared to Whites, Blacks were more likely to have significantly higher odds of sickle cell crisis (odds ratio [OR]: 3.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.66-4.14) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.37-2.02). There was no difference in mortality between Blacks and Whites. Compared to Hispanics, Blacks had significantly higher odds of sickle cell crisis (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.19-1.53) and blindness (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.22-7.11), lower odds of asplenia (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45-0.71) and gallstones (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.95). However, Blacks had statistically significantly lower odds of mortality of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38-0.93) than Hispanics. CONCLUSION: Prevalent sickle cell type, severity, complications, and comorbidities vary in different races. Physicians need to be aware of these differences to manage sickle cell patients efficiently. This study hopes to inform further research regarding the reasons for varying disease characteristics among racial groups and bridge a gap in tailored management protocols.","67":"INTRODUCTION: Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been standard of care for symptomatic gallstone disease for almost 30 years, the use of routine intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) remains controversial. There are marked variations in the use IOC during LC internationally. Debate has continued about its benefit, in part because of inconsistent benefit, time, and resources required to complete IOC. This literature review is presented as a debate to outline the arguments in favour of and against routine IOC in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: A standard literature review of PubMed, Medline, OVID, EMBASE, CINHIL and Web of Science was performed, specifically for literature pertaining to the use of IOC or alternative intra-operative methods for imaging the biliary tree in LC. Two authors assembled the evidence in favour, and two authors assembled the evidence against. RESULTS: From this controversies piece we found that there is little discernible change in the number of BDIs requiring repair procedures. Although IOC is associated with a small absolute reduction in bile duct injury, there are other confounding factors, including a change in laparoscopic learning curves. Alternative technologies such as intra-operative ultrasound, indocyanine green imaging, and increased access to ERCP may contribute to a reduction in the need for routine IOC. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of 30 years of accumulating evidence, routine IOC remains controversial. As technology advances, it is likely that alternative methods of imaging and accessing the bile duct will supplant routine IOC.","68":"BACKGROUND: Oct4 has critical role in maintaining pluripotency, proliferative potential, and self-renewal capacity in embryonic stem and germ cells. Although Oct4 has been shown to be upregulated in many cancers, its clinical significance in gallbladder carcinoma is poorly understood. METHODS: We studied the expression profile of Oct4 in 61 GBC and 30 chronic cholecystitis (as control) using real time RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The expression data was correlated with clinico-pathological parameters. The diagnostic utility was assessed through ROC curve, and prognostic value was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Oct4 was significantly upregulated at mRNA as well as protein levels. The higher mRNA expression shows significant association with late stage, late T stage, and higher grade of tumor. A significant positive correlation was also observed with stage, T stage, and tumor grade. Sum score analysis of protein expression shows positive correlation with stage and the presence or absence of gallstone in tumor samples. The ROC curve analysis revealed the moderate diagnostic potential of Oct4. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients having higher expression of Oct4 were having low mean survival compared with the patients with lower Oct4 expression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggests that higher expression of Oct4 may serve as potential biological indicator for tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis of GBC.","69":"Herniation of abdominal contents through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity can occur after blunt abdominal injury, resulting in a permanently acquired diaphragmatic hernia. Their clinical presentation is varied and non-specific, which can go unnoticed for a long duration. A 27-year-old male presented with right upper quadrant pain and right-sided pleuritic chest pain for the past 20 days. His past medical history included high-impact blunt trauma a few years back. His workup revealed a right-sided diaphragmatic hernia through which the gallbladder had herniated into the thoracic cavity, along with liver and hepatic flexure of the colon. The gallbladder contained gallstones which were the cause of his symptoms. The patient was managed successfully with a laparotomy and repair of the diaphragmatic hernia and cholecystectomy. After blunt abdominal trauma, right-sided diaphragmatic injury is less common because most of the trauma is absorbed by the liver, providing a protective effect. The sign and symptoms of acquired diaphragmatic hernia lack sensitivity and specificity, due to which many cases remain undiagnosed and are incidentally picked up on chest auscultation where bowel sounds are audible in the chest, and breath sounds on the affected side are absent, whereas patients have complaints of respiratory difficulty and recurrent pneumonia. Chest and abdominal imagining in the form of chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound can help diagnose. The case we present was a unique presentation of acquired right-sided diaphragmatic hernia resulting in herniation of the gallbladder in the right-sided chest and leading to acute cholecystitis. The treatment modality is surgical repair of the diaphragm. Any patient presenting with unusual symptoms of pneumonia or abdominal pain should be investigated, especially patients with a history of blunt abdominal trauma.","70":"A cholecystoenteric fistula is an anomalous communicating tract between the gallbladder and any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a rare complication of gallstone disease and typically affects elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities. These fistulae can present in a variety of ways, and the diagnosis is often made only after extensive workup. Despite notable advances in imaging techniques in the last half-century, a considerable number of cases are still discovered incidentally during open or laparoscopic surgery. We present a series of 3 cases, each with different etiologies and presentations, but all of whom were found to have a cholecystoenteric fistula. Each case was managed differently, highlighting the diversity of this intriguing condition.","71":"OBJECTIVES: Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) refers to the continuation or recurrence of biliary colic and any other gastrointestinal symptoms present prior to cholecystectomy. Given that PCS is rare and underestimated in Saudi Arabia, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of PCS among Saudis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included randomly gathered subjects who self-administered the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire from September 6 to October 7, 2022. RESULTS: A total of 518 participants who underwent cholecystectomies were included; most were female (73.6%), 153 (29.5%) were 19 to 25 years old, and the vast majority were Saudi Arabian (91.1%). The average preoperative weight was 71 +\/- 20.7 kg (range 20 to 258), and the mean current weight was 69 +\/- 19.4 kg (range 30 to 257). About 137 (26.4%) had a chronic disease, most frequently hypertension (37.2%). In the past week, most participants experienced some trouble doing strenuous activities (42.9%), slight pain (37.6%), fatigue (32.2%), insomnia (37.5%), and weakness (38.2%). There were no significant associations between age, nationality, or residence with the QLQ-C30 score (P-value = 0.152, 0.262, 0.071, respectively). A significant association was observed between gender and QLQ-C30 score (P-value < 0.001), with females scoring higher than their male counterparts. Females also reported having a higher quality of life than males. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PCS was higher than reported elsewhere.","72":null,"73":"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract with a poor prognosis. It is important to understand the molecular processes associated with the pathogenesis of early stage GBC and identify proteins useful for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Here, we have carried out an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of tumor tissues from early stage GBC cases (stage I, n=7 and stage II, n=5) and non-tumor controls (n=6) from gallstone disease (GSD). We identified 357 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) based on >\/= 2 unique peptides and >\/= 2 fold change with p value < 0.05. Pathway analysis using the STRING database showed, 'neutrophil degranulation' to be the major upregulated pathway that includes proteins such as MPO, PRTN3, S100A8, MMP9, DEFA1, AZU, and 'ECM organization' to be the major downregulated pathway that includes proteins such as COL14A1, COL1A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, BGN, DCN. Western blot and\/or IHC analysis confirmed the elevated expression of MPO, PRTN3 and S100A8 in early stage of the disease. Based on the above results, we hypothesize that there is an increased neutrophil infiltration in tumor tissue and neutrophil degranulation leading to degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins promoting cancer cell invasion in the early stage GBC. Some of the proteins (MPO, MMP9, DEFA1) associated with 'neutrophil degranulation' showed the presence of 'signal sequence' suggesting their potential as circulatory markers for early detection of GBC. Overall, the study presents a protein dataset associated with early stage GBC.","74":"Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas and a leading gastrointestinal cause of admission in the United States. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol. It is rarely caused by medications. Azathioprine-induced pancreatitis is rare and is more common in patients with Crohn's Disease. In this case report, we present a rare case of azathioprine-induced pancreatitis in a 58-year-old African American patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.","75":"Gallstones are diseases of the biliary system caused by cholesterol supersaturation and\/or deficiency in bile salts in bile. Early studies have shown that symptomatic gallstones are primarily a disease of non-smokers, raising the possibility that nicotine can prevent gallstone formation. The present study investigated the effect of nicotine on the formation of cholesterol gallstone in C57BL\/6J mice. C57BL\/6J mice (eight-weeks-old) were fed a normal or lithogenic diet (basic feed 82.45%, fat 15.8%, cholesterol 1.25% and sodium cholate 0.5%) and divided into five groups: normal diet (ND); ND + high dose nicotine (H); lithogenic diet (LD); LD + low dose nicotine (L) and LD + nicotine (H). They were treated with or without nicotine injection for 10 weeks. Nicotine treatment did not change the rate of cholesterol gallstone formation. There was no difference in TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 among the five groups. The LD group showed the highest cholesterol levels and there was significant suppression of the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and total bile acid levels in the serum of the nicotine-treated mice. Quantitative PCR showed nicotine altered few bile acid metabolism-related genes expression in liver tissue and significantly altered cholesterol-metabolism genes in gallbladder tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting showed that protein levels of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and megalin in the gallbladder increased in the lithogenic-diet mice, which was significantly suppressed in the nicotine-treated mice. In vitro studies using gallbladder epithelial cells showed that chenodeoxycholic acids increased megalin expression, which could be attenuated by nicotine. Nicotine could regulate bile acid metabolism via the FXR-megalin\/cubilin pathways, which potentially contribute to cholesterol nucleation and subsequent gallstone formation.","76":"This study aimed to decrease the incidence of residual stones in the cystic duct and consequently decrease the incidences of intractable pain and the formation of a small gallbladder after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). We changed the order of the clamps when performing LC, used the \"semicut\" skill of the cystic duct, and removed the stones residing in the cystic duct. A total of 45 patients underwent the operation, and all operations were completed successfully. This technique did not increase the operation time or difficulty. In conclusion, the \"semicut\" skill of the cystic duct is a safe and feasible surgical method that may change the occurrence of intractable pain after LC.","77":"BACKGROUND: Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) is a bariatric procedure used in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. However, to date, the data on BPD-DS among Chinese patients with obesity is completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: This is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BPD-DS in the treatment of Chinese patients with obesity. METHODS: Data from 12 patients undergoing BPD-DS between September 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed retrospectively to evaluate complications, weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and nutritional status. RESULTS: All patients completed the 1-year follow-up. There was no conversion to laparotomy or death. Mean operative time was 257.08 +\/- 29.27 min. The median length of stay was 7 days (ranging from 4-38 days). Complications occurred in three patients. The 1-year body mass index was 25.13 +\/- 4.71 kg\/m(2) with a mean excess weight loss of 100.11 +\/- 33.29% and a mean total weight loss of 43.22 +\/- 7.71%. Remission was achieved in 100% (7\/7 cases) for type 2 diabetes, in 83.3% (10\/12 cases) for hypertension, and in 62.5% (5\/8 cases) for hyperuricemia. At 1 year after BPD-DS, the prevalence of albumin deficiency was 16.7%, for iron deficiency was 16.7%, and for zinc deficiency was 50%. There were 8.3% of the patients who were anemic. High deficiency rates for vitamins were presented mainly in vitamin A and vitamin E: vitamin A in 58.3% of the patients and vitamin E in 50% of the patients. The prevalence of asymptomatic gallstones increased significantly from 0% preoperatively to 41.7% postoperatively. CONCLUSION: BPD-DS had excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities among Chinese patients with obesity. However, high rates of nutritional deficiencies and complications were found after BPD-DS, especially for vitamin A and vitamin E.","78":"BACKGROUND: Choledocholithiasis complicated with cholecystolithiasis is a common disease. This study explores a novel strategy, called ERCP-based transcystic gallbladder-preserving cholecystolithotomy, for the simultaneous removal of common bile duct stones and gallbladder stones. METHODS: From December 2018 to June 2021, all patients with cholecystolithiasis and common bile duct stones who met the criteria for gallbladder preservation in our hospital were included in the study and prospectively followed up. RESULTS: We included 48 patients, including 20 patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. All patients successfully underwent ERCP to remove common bile duct stones. One patient had gallbladder perforation during gallbladder-preserving cholecystolithotomy. The guide wire successfully entered the gallbladder, and the transpapillary gallbladder metal-covered stent was successfully placed in 44 patients. The technical success rate was 91.67% (44\/48). All stones were removed in 34 patients, for a clinical success rate of 77.27% (34\/44). The total postoperative complication rate was 6.25% (3\/48), with 2 cases of pancreatitis (4.17%) and 1 case of cholangitis (2.08%). Three patients were lost to follow-up. Among the 31 patients who were followed up for a mean of 27 months (6-40), 5 patients (16.13%) experienced gallstone recurrence. The recurrence rates at 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months and 36 months were 0%, 3.23%, 6.45%, 12.9%, and 16.13%, respectively. CONCLUSION: For patients with cholecystolithiasis and common bile duct stones, ERCP-based transcystic gallbladder-preserving cholecystolithotomy without gallbladder incision can preserve gallbladder structure, and this procedure is safe and feasible for the protection of gallbladder function.Clinical trial registration: The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and the registry number is ChiCTR1900028006.","79":"Background and Objectives: Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment method in patients who experience typical biliary pain with or without gallstones, medical treatment has not been extensively studied. Rowachol is a potent choleretic agent, comprising six cyclic monoterpenes. This study aimed to investigate the clinical improvement and changes in gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) by Rowachol treatment in patients with typical biliary pain. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 138 patients with typical biliary pain who underwent cholescintigraphy from July 2016 to April 2022. We included patients who received Rowachol for more than 2 months and underwent follow-up GBEF measurements. Finally, we analyzed pre- and post-treatment symptoms and GBEF. GBEF was calculated using the fatty meal-stimulated cholescintigraphy. Results: This retrospective observational study included 31 patients; their median age was 46.0 (range, 26.0-72.7) years, and 22 (71.0%) were female. Overall, 9 (29.0%) patients had gallbladder stones or sludges (maximum size: 2 mm) on initial transabdominal ultrasonography. During a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the symptoms of 21 (67.7%) patients were resolved after a median Rowachol treatment of 10.0 months. The mean GBEF was significantly improved after Rowachol treatment (initial cholescintigraphy: 42.6% +\/- 16.2%; follow-up cholescintigraphy: 53.0% +\/- 18.1%, p = 0.012). In patients with a GBEF <\/=35% (n = 9), Rowachol significantly increased the GBEF from 21.3% +\/- 8.3% to 49.1% +\/- 20.7% (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Rowachol may have beneficial medical effects that can improve gallbladder dysfunction and treatment response.","80":"It is rare to detect echogenic content in the fetal gallbladder. The etiology, natural course, and prognosis of this condition remain unclear. In addition to providing a systematic review of this topic, we suggest a plan for patient follow-up. From a total of 100 database entries identified in PubMed, EMBASE, and ICTRP reviews, we selected 34 studies in which we investigated the ultrasound features and outcome of this condition. There were 226 fetuses with gallbladder echogenic content identified. Seventy-two fetuses were found to have biliary sludge; thirty cases had a single hyperechogenic focus, and one hundred fetuses had multiple foci in the gallbladder. There were 16 cases of distal shadowing, 37 fetuses with comet tail and twinkling, and 26 cases with no acoustic artifacts. Nine cases of spontaneous resolution before birth have been documented; nine fetuses exhibited no echogenic content at birth, and 138 cases of resolution of echogenic content within the first year of life have been described. Typically, the condition resolves spontaneously during the postnatal period. After adequately reassuring the parents, the patients should be monitored for spontaneous resolution; medical or surgical intervention is not indicated. Asymptomatic patients can be managed with a wait-and-see strategy.","81":"Biliary anatomic variations are usually asymptomatic, but they may cause problems in diagnostic investigations and interventional and surgical procedures, increasing both their technical difficulty and their postoperative complication rates. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of anatomic variations in the intrahepatic biliary ducts (IHBD) in relation to demographical and clinical characteristics in a large study population requiring magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for various clinical conditions. The possible association between IHBD and extrahepatic biliary ducts (EHBD) variants was then explored. From January 2017 to May 2019, 1004 patients underwent MRCP. Demographical and clinical data were collected. IHBD and EHBD anatomy were recorded and the EHBD anatomy was classified using both qualitative and quantitative classifications. The presence of a type 3 EHBD variant (an abnormal proximal cystic duct [CD] insertion) in both qualitative and quantitative classifications and an intrapancreatic CD were associated with the presence of IHBD variants at univariate analysis (p = 0.008, p = 0.019, and p = 0.001, respectively). The presence of a posterior or medial insertion of the CD into the EHBD was a strong predictive factor of the presence of IHBD variants both at uni- and multivariate analysis (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003 for posterior insertion and p = 0.002 and p = 0.002 for medial insertion, respectively). The presence of gallstones on MRCP resulted in a strong predictor of the presence of an anatomical variant of the IHBD both at uni- and multivariate analysis (p = 0.027 and p = 0.046, respectively). In conclusion, the presence of a type 3 variant of the EHBD, an intrapancreatic CD and, especially, a posterior\/medial CD insertion into the EHBD represent predictive factors of the concomitant presence of IHBD variants, thus radiologists must be vigilant when encountering these EHBD configurations and always remember to \"look up\" at the IHBD. Finally, the presence of an IHBD variant is a strong predictive factor of gallstones.","82":"INTRODUCTION: At present, the pre- and postdissection regions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) are uniformly described by the term \"hepatocystic triangle\" (HCT). It is unclear whether a distinction needs to be made. An observational study was undertaken to evaluate the predissection hepatocystic region (pre-HCR) and the postdissection hepatocystic region (post-HCR). Also, the dissection-related changes to the contents of the pre-HCR (\"proper HCT\") were evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was done. The operative videos of patients who underwent fluorescence-guided surgery from December 2021 to February 2022 were reviewed. Patients with gallstone disease without complications (GSD) were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, biliary pancreatitis, biliary fistulas, and gallbladder wall thickening of >\/=3 mm on ultrasonography. RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent LC for GSD using standard dissection methods. The boundaries of the pre-HCR were identified before dissection in all patients. The dissection resulted in a quadrangular space lateral to the \"proper HCT\" in all. The post-HCR contained the undissected \"proper-HCT\" and the quadrangular space in all. The post-HCR area was 4.4 times that of the pre-HCR (3.2-13.1). The peritoneum over the \"proper HCT\" was unbreached in all patients, and the target structures were delineated outside of it. A critical view of safety (CVS) was demonstrated outside of the \"proper HCT\" in all patients. CONCLUSION: During near-infrared fluorescence-guided LC for GSD, there is no fat clearance in the \"HCT.\" The hepatocystic region before and at the conclusion were distinctly different. The uniform usage of the term \"HCT\" does not convey this change.","83":"BACKGROUND: The physiological changes of pregnancy increase the risk of gallstone formation and choledocholithiasis. Traditionally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been the main approach for managing choledocholithiasis during pregnancy, but recent progress in laparoscopic bile duct exploration (LBDE) has demonstrated this technique as a safe and effective alternative option. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study of all patients who underwent LBDE during pregnancy from five centers with proven experience in LBDE between January 2010 and June 2020 was performed. The primary endpoint was to analyze the role of LBDE during pregnancy and to further characterize its position as a safe and effective alternative for the management of choledocholithiasis. A systematic review of the published literature relating to LBDE during pregnancy until February 2022 was also performed. RESULTS: Five institutions reported performing LBDE during pregnancy in 8 patients. Median surgical time was 75 min (range: 60-140 min). The bile duct was cleared successfully in all patients, and the median hospital stay was 2 days (range: 1-3 days). The literature review identified a total of 7 patients with a successful CBD clearance rate of 86%. There were no major maternal, fetal, or pregnancy-related complications in any of the total 15 patients included. The symptomatic common bile duct lithiasis with deranged liver function tests was the most frequent indication (n=7). CONCLUSION: LBDE during pregnancy appears to be safe and effective. More evidence reporting outcomes of LBDE during pregnancy is needed before any strong recommendations can be made.","84":"Gallstone ileus (GI) is a rare cause of acute abdomen in an emergency setting and a rare complication of cholelithiasis in the elderly, with a female prevalence. Radiologists play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition and, with a multimodal approach, diagnostic accuracy usually increases. Spontaneous resolution of GI has previously been reported for stones smaller than 2 cm. Gallstones usually require surgical management; however, in patients with comorbidities and at high risk of surgical complications, a conservative approach may be considered. Herein, we report the case of an 84-year-old woman who came to the emergency department with an acute abdomen pain caused by a GI, with a 2.6 cm gallstone that was revealed on computed tomography and which was followed by diagnostic imaging with spontaneous resolution.","85":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by multiple strictures of the biliary tree. Patients with PSC frequently require repeated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. These procedures are encumbered by an increased incidence of infectious adverse events such as cholangitis. Evidence regarding whether antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) should be administered is sparse; however, prophylaxis is recommended. We aimed to determine whether AP affects the rate of postprocedural infectious and overall adverse events. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study and extracted all ERCP procedures with indicated PSC performed between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2019, which were registered in the Swedish Registry for Gallstone Surgery and ERCP (GallRiks). The exclusion criteria were incomplete 30-day follow-up, non-index procedures, or ongoing antibiotics. The main outcomes were postprocedural infectious adverse events and overall adverse events at the 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 2144 procedures with indication of PSC were eligible for inclusion. AP was administered in 1407 (66%) of these procedures. Patients receiving AP were slightly younger (44 vs 46 years, P = 0.005) and had more comorbidities (ASA >\/=3, 19.8% vs 13.6%; P  < 0.001). Procedures with AP demonstrated an infectious adverse event rate of 3.3% compared to 4.5% for non-AP procedures (P = 0.19). Postprocedural infectious adverse events (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-1.21) and overall adverse events (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60-1.04) did not differ between AP and non-AP. CONCLUSION: Patients with PSC who undergo ERCP have the same frequency of adverse events regardless of whether AP was used.","86":"In euthyroid population, it is uncertain whether there is sex-specific difference in the associations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or its components with gallstone disease (GSD); in general population, MetS increases the risk of GSD. This was a cross-sectional study to investigate the sex-specific difference in the prevalence of MetS according to GSD status and the associations of MetS or its components with GSD in Chinese euthyroid population. The total prevalence of GSD was 8.1% (6.5% in men and 11.0% in women, with a significant difference (p < 0.001)). The total presence of MetS was 10.7% (12.1% in men and 8.2% in women,with a significant difference (p = 0.001)). The age-adjusted odds ratio of MetS for GSD was 2.775 in men (p < 0.001), 2.543 in women (p = 0.007) and 2.503 in the oveall samples (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that fasting plasma glucose (FPG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were associated with the prevalence of GSD. After adjustment for age, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that above three parameters were still significantly associated with the risk of GSD in general population; FPG and HDL-C but not TSH levels were significantly associated with the risk of GSD in men; and FPG and TSH levels but not HDL-C in women. Our study demonstrated that in euthyroid population, MetS appeared to be strongly associated with GSD regardless of sex, and FPG and TSH were two independent risk factors for GSD in men, while FPG and HDL-C in women.","87":"INTRODUCTION: Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon adrenal tumor with a predilection for the female population. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old woman was referred to our attention to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease. She underwent a left adrenalectomy for ACC 5 years before; the follow-up was negative for relapse. During the preoperative study an Ultrasound Scanner study demonstrated a liver lesion in S6 - S7, confirmed by a Magnetic Resonance. A PET identified also a lesion on L1 vertebra. The hepatic US-guided biopsy resulted positive for ACC metastasis. After a muldisciplinary evaluation, the patients underwent a local approach to treat both hepatic and vertebral lesions. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in order to prevent biliary and pancreatic complications. The minimally invasive technique was adopted in order to reduce surgical trauma in oncological patients, even the previous abdominal surgery and percutaneous hepatic treatment. The patient is alive, with no recurrence after 12 months from local treatments. CONCLUSION: This is a very unusual case of double ACC metastases, discovered after the end of standard follow-up and locally treated. The patient is recurrence-free 12 months after these procedures. Minimally invasive approach to treat symptomatic cholecystectomy was used in order to avoid pancreato-biliary complications. This study emphasized the necessity to realize tailored protocols for the follow-up of rare neoplasia, as ACC.

METHODS: This study was a prospective study of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (GSD, n = 51) and gallbladder cancer (GBC, n = 46) and controls without any biliary disease (n = 46). All the participants underwent 2D USG and SWE of the gallbladder. Grey-scale ultrasound and SWE were done in the different regions in the gallbladder. RESULTS: The median age of the patients with GSD was 49 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 33-55), GBC was 55 years (IQR: 46-65), and controls was 37 years (IQR: 27-48.25). In patients with GBC, asymmetrical mural thickening was the predominant imaging pattern (n = 24, 52.2%). The mean SWe of the abnormal area in GBC (34.99 +\/- 17.77 kPa [n = 46]) was significantly higher than that of the uninvolved region (18.27 +\/- 8.12 kPa [n = 35]; P < .01). The mean SWe of the uninvolved region in GBC (18.27 +\/- 8.12 kPa [n = 35]) was also significantly higher (P < .01) than that of GSD (12.27 +\/- 4.13 kPa [n = 51]) and controls (10.52 +\/- 3.75 kPa [n = 46]). On ROC analysis, AUC of 0.927, at a cut-off of 20 kPa, sensitivity was 91.3%, specificity was 83.5%, positive likelihood ratio was 5.54, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.10 to diagnose GBC. CONCLUSION: The 2D SWE is a reliable adjunctive tool to grey-scale USG in differentiating the malignant from benign gallbladder wall and may help to pick up early malignancy in GSD.","89":"A bypass procedure such as a hepaticoduodenostomy may be an alternative to the traditional choledochoduodenostomy in the management of the retained, impacted distal common bile duct (CBD) stone, especially in the presence of sepsis. We present herein a hepaticoduodenotomy performed for a retained, impacted distal CBD stone in a low-resource setting with a good outcome. This impacted stone had complicated an open cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis by causing the dehiscence of the cystic duct stump as a result of distal biliary obstruction.","90":"Acute pancreatitis is a common disease in patients presenting to the emergency room in any hospital. The most common causes are alcohol ingestion and gallstone disease. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings and elevated serum amylase and lipase levels. Imaging is often not necessary but may be used to confirm the diagnosis or rule out any other pathology or to evaluate for any complications. The majority of patients will have a mild, self-limiting disease but others may develop a severe fulminant course with organ failure. These patients are at high risk of developing complications, morbidity or mortality. Treatment of acute pancreatitis includes supportive treatment with antibiotics, fluids, analgesics and early enteral feeding. Several scores have been developed to predict the course of pancreatitis and help make informed decisions, monitoring and timely intervention. The majority of them are complicated, require extensive and expensive interventions or require time. Harmless acute pancreatitis score (HAPS) is one such score that is easy to calculate and is done at the time of admission, bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) is another one requiring more parameters. The parameters used to calculate it are easily available and can be done at a majority of healthcare facilities in developing countries. HAPS thus seems to be a good option in aiding doctors in assessing acute pancreatitis. It may be considered as a standard scoring for acute pancreatitis for early and effective management. We have tried to study and compare the superiority of HAPS over BISAP in predicting prognosis in acute pancreatitis.","91":"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis is the most common gastrointestinal cause of hospital admissions in the United States of which biliary or gallstone disease is the most common inciting factor. AIM: Estimate the effects of frailty on burden, costs, and causes for hospitalization in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. METHODS: We analysed the Nationwide Readmission Database from 2016 to 2019 for patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. Patients were categorized into two groups, frail and non-frail, based on the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. Logistic and Cox regression were used to predict the impact of frailty on 30-day readmission, length of stay, mortality, and costs. RESULTS: 162,202 index hospitalizations with acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis were identified, of whom 59.2% (n = 96,045) were female and 22.49% (n = 36,475) were classified as frail. Readmissions within 30 days were higher among frail patients (12.58% vs 7.09%, P < 0.001) compared to non-frail patients, respectively. Regression modeling showed that frail patients had higher odds of readmission (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.24-1.42, P < 0.001), longer lengths of stay (8.18 days vs 4.11 days), and higher average costs of hospitalization ($21,511 vs $12,261) compared to non-frail patients, respectively. Cox regression showed that frail patients had a higher risk of mortality (HR 5.43; 95% Cl 4.06-7.29, P < 0.001) compared to non-frail patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is independently associated with higher mortality and burden of healthcare utilization in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. We suggest using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score as part of the treatment algorithm in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis.","92":"Gallbladder calcification known as porcelain gallbladder (PGB) is most often asymptomatic disease developing in consequence of chronic inflammatory process in the course of other gallbladder diseases (gallstone disease). In the past PGB was reported to be associated with carcinoma of gallbladder, with the incidence of 30%, nowadays recent studies suggesting a rate of 6%. Patients with PGB due to malignancy risk undergo , prophylactic cholecystectomy although as recent studies show part of them could avoid it. AIM: Presentation of a case of a patient with calcification of the gallbladder wall and suspicion of gallbladder cancer and a review of the literature. A CASE REPORT: A 66-year-old woman was admitted with a diagnosis of PGB and concomitant diseases with a high risk of adverse events. PGB was detected through incidentally 4 months earlier, during the diagnosis of abdominal pain caused by the sigmoid volvulus. Computed tomography revealed enlarged (125mm x 57mm) PGB and abnormal tissue components into the fundus of gallbladder- suspected malignancy. No detected lymphadenopathy and growing cancer into liver, or invading, nearby organs. The patient underwent open extended (radical) cholecystectomy. Gallbladder was excised with fused part of greater omentum and adjacent, wedge-shaped part of liver parenchyma. Lymphadenectomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament and resection of cystic duct stump was also performed. There was no postoperative complication, patient was discharged six days after the surgery. No gallbladder cancer was found in the histopathological examination. There were fund cholecystolithiasis, chronic cholecystitis with hyalinization and calcification of the wall, chronic limphadenitis and glandular epithelium in the stump of the cystic duct. RESULTS: Patient with PGB and suspicion of gallbladder cancer was treated with open extended cholecystectomy. Histopathological examination has not revealed gallbladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Open extended cholecystectomy has proven to be an effective and safe treatment for a patient with a porcelain gallbladder at high risk of cancer.","93":"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is relatively a new approach for clearing choledocholithiasis. The aim of this study is to assess the safety of this approach to clearing common bile duct (CBD) stones on an index admission including emergency setting. METHODS: Retrospective data collection and analysis were carried out for 207 consecutive cases of LCBDE performed in Royal Cornwall Hospital over 6 years (2015-2020). Patients were divided into two groups (Index admission vs elective) then both groups compared. RESULTS: A total of 207 cases of LCBDE were performed in our unit during the time period. One hundred twenty-two operations were performed on the index admission and 85 on a subsequent elective list. Mean operative time was 146 +\/- 64 min in the index admission group and 145 +\/- 65 min in the elective group (p = 0.913). Length of stay post-operatively was 3.3 +\/- 6.3 days in the index admission cases and 3.5 +\/- 4.6 days after elective cases. Successful clearance was achieved at the end of the operation in 116 patients in the index admission group, clearance failed in one case and negative exploration in 5 patients. In the elective group 83 patients had a successful clearance at the end of the operation, and 2 patients has had a negative exploration. Twelve patients (index admission group) and 8 patients of the elective cases required post-operative Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to manage retained stones, recurrent stones and bile leak (p = 0.921). Three patients required re-operation for post-operative complications in each group. CONCLUSION: Common bile duct exploration in index admission is safe with high success rate if performed by well-trained surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills.","94":"Video 1Endoscopic approach for management of dropped gallstones using percutaneous cholangioscopy.","95":"Video 1A large, impacted gallstone is treated unsuccessfully with electrohydraulic lithotripsy; however, fragmentation and removal is accomplished using endoscopic laser lithotripsy.","96":"A 83-year-old woman with previous history of gallstone was hospitalized with intermittent melena of 1-week duration. Gastroscopy showed a protuberant mass with thick pedicle and superficial ulcer measuring 3.0 x 4.0-cm in the lower gastric body (Fig. 1. A). Biopsy of the ulcer indicated chronic inflammation without evidence of malignancy. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a well-defined and mixed density mass with heterogeneous enhancement in the gastric body. The final diagnosis was gastric angiolipoma.","97":"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infection is an important cause of cholelithiasis or gallstones and interferes with its treatment. There is no consensus on bile microbial culture profiles in previous studies, and identified microbial spectrum and drug resistance is helpful for targeted preventive and therapeutic drugs in the perioperative period. AIM: To analyze the bile microbial spectrum of patients with cholelithiasis and the drug susceptibility patterns in order to establish an empirical antibiotic treatment for cholelithiasis-associated infection. METHODS: A retrospective single-center study was conducted on patients diagnosed with cholelithiasis between May 2013 and December 2018. RESULTS: This study included 185 patients, of whom 163 (88.1%) were diagnosed with gallstones and 22 (11.9%) were diagnosed with gallstones and common bile duct stones (CBDSs). Bile culture in 38 cases (20.5%) was positive. The presence of CBDSs (OR = 5.4, 95%CI: 1.3-21.9, P = 0.03) and longer operation time (> 80 min) (OR = 4.3, 95%CI: 1.4-13.1, P = 0.01) were identified as independent risk factors for positive bile culture. Gram-negative bacteria were detected in 28 positive bile specimens, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) (19\/28) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5\/28) were the most frequently identified species. Gram-positive bacteria were present in 10 specimens. The resistance rate to cephalosporin in E. coli was above 42% and varied across generations. All the isolated E. coli strains were sensitive to carbapenems, with the exception of one imipenem-resistant strain. K. pneumoniae showed a similar resistance spectrum to E. coli. Enterococcus spp. was largely sensitive to glycopeptides and penicillin, except for a few strains of E. faecium. CONCLUSION: The presence of common bile duct stones and longer operation time were identified as independent risk factors for positive bile culture in patients with cholelithiasis. The most commonly detected bacterium was E. coli. The combination of beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors prescribed perioperatively appears to be effective against bile pathogens and is recommended. Additionally, regular monitoring of emerging resistance patterns is required in the future.","98":"BACKGROUND AIMS: We examined gallbladder and biliary tract mortality predictors in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1988-1994, with 31 years of linked mortality data, and gallstone disease prevalence trends and associations in NHANES 2017-March 2020 prepandemic data. APPROACH RESULTS: In NHANES 1988-1994, 18,794 participants were passively followed for mortality, identified by death certificate underlying or contributing causes, by linkage to the National Death Index through 2019. In NHANES 2017-March 2020, gallstone disease history was ascertained from 9,232 adults. During NHANES 1988-2019 follow-up (median, 23.3 y), 8,580 deaths occurred from all causes and 72 deaths with gallbladder or biliary tract disease. In multivariable-adjusted analysis, older age, male sex, prediabetes or diabetes, and physical inactivity were associated with gallbladder and biliary tract mortality, and non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American race-ethnicity were inversely associated. Between 1988-1994 and 2017-March 2020, gallstone disease prevalence increased from 7.4% to 13.9%, and gallbladder surgery from 6.0% to 11.6%. In 2017-March 2020 in multivariable-adjusted analysis, female sex, diabetes, liver disease, proton pump inhibitors, abdominal pain, and increased age, BMI, and liver stiffness were associated with gallstone disease, and non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian race and alcohol were inversely associated. CONCLUSIONS: In the U.S. population, gallstone disease prevalence doubled over 3 decades, possibly due to worsening of metabolic risk factors and growth of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Gallbladder and biliary tract mortality and gallstone disease associations included factors such as prediabetes or diabetes, liver stiffness and proton pump inhibitors.","99":"BACKGROUND: Common Bile duct (CBD) measurement is a crucial aspect in the evaluation of the biliary tree. Whether the CBD undergoes any compensatory change in diameter after laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is still up for discussion. The aim of this study was to investigate CBD diameter changes after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study is divided into 2 sections. The first part assessing CBD diameter changes after laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to gallstones or gallbladder polyps, involved 85 patients, who underwent MRCP procedures. These patients aged between 30 and 85 were divided into an interval LC group (group A, n=56) and a remote LC group (group B, n=29). In group A, the common CBD diameters were measured at their widest portions on MRCP obtained before and after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Measurements of the CBD diameters were repeated on MRCP obtained twice after the surgery in group B.Section 2 consisted of 38 patients who had choledocholithiasis and were treated with laparoscopic CBD exploration and T-tube placement. These patients aged 26 to 86 formed the interval LCBDE group (group C). The CBD widest diameters were measured on MRCP before LCBDE and after T-tube cholangiography for these individuals.Patients in groups A and C were further divided into 5 and those in group B into 4 age-related subgroups to facilitate statistical analysis. The Pearson correlation test was performed to find any relationship between CBD diameters and age in groups A and B. Paired sample T test was used to compare the significant difference between the 2 sets of CBD diameters in each study group and their subgroups. RESULTS: In the interval LC group, the post-LC mean CBD diameter was significantly wider when compared with the preoperative mean diameter ( P <0.05). There was a significant difference between the first and second post-LC means CBD diameter in the remote LC group ( P <0.05). In group C, the mean CBD diameter measured on T-tube cholangiography after LCBDE was significantly smaller than the preoperative dilated mean diameter ( P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant dilation occurring in the common bile duct diameter after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Furthermore, our remote LC group also supported that claim by showing significant dilation between the first and second post-cholecystectomy CBD diameter values. And lastly, our interval LCBDE sample's initial dilation of the CBD diameters was reduced after surgery and stone extraction."},"CI":{"0":["Copyright (c) 2023 the Author(s).
